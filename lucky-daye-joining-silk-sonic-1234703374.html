I’m literally shy. And I look up to Bruno [Mars] so much. He don’t know that. He don’t know that I know every single song, every single inflection, every single rift, every single chord, every single interpolation. I know these. I’ve sat in hotel rooms alone in the dark with no money listening to Bruno, he don’t know that and I still never told him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1325814406.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued to clarify his rumored involvement in the creation of An Evening with Silk Sonic.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I try not to step on toes. I’ll like, throw melodies and throw certain words. Sometimes it’ll get used, sometimes it won’t get used, and if I’m not the one to be like ‘oh I did that,’ nobody’s gonna say nothing. I’ve heard something, but I’m not going to be like ‘yo Bruno,’ because at the end of the day it was a collective effort, and the energy that was in the room, that’s what made the song.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">DJ Ace continued to ask if Lucky Daye had ever been considered for membership in the Grammy Award-winning duo.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Probably, but then I wouldn’t have made <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/lucky-daye-candy-drip-album-tour-1234638745/>Candy Drip</a>,” Daye explained.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Still, the potential for the trio to become official is still present.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You have Anderson [.paak] on the drums, you could put me on the bass, Bruno on the guitar.

And at the time when we were all hanging out for a bit, we were trying to figure out what things were before&nbsp;Silk Sonic, before anything [took place]. We never put anything out on wax and were mostly affiliated with each other in some way. I know that Bruno is a fan of Lucky and vice versa, so, even in the future, I would love for something to happen. Whether it’s Silk Sonic and Lucky Daye or Bruno Mars and Lucky doing stuff together, who knows?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6HCpLfYZpuasZVit7C1zaKloGWjnrmsedKopaKbXWZ%2FdICWaWpsb2Rk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Two days later, the bodies of three other young women were found close by along desolate stretches of coastline on New York’s Long Island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Suspected-New-York-serial-kller-used-the-mobile-phone-of.jpg><p>Rex Heuermann, a 59-year-old Manhattan architect, has been charged with three murders, including that of Barthelemy, after being apprehended at his Long Island residence on July 14.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698712217_362_Suspected-New-York-serial-kller-used-the-mobile-phone-of.jpg><p>The traumatic experience for Barthelemy’s family escalated as the suspect used her own cellphone to torment her relatives in 2009 with multiple calls shortly after her disappearance, including one in which he confessed to killing her.</p><p>Amanda F, Barthelemy’s sister, revealed, ‘He killed her; he raped her. Maybe one day he’d tell me where she was,’ to PIX11, after receiving phone calls at the age of 15.</p><p>Amanda also disclosed that the man had been monitoring her following her sister’s murder, stating, ‘He knew my name. He knew what I looked like.’</p><p>‘He had a strong accent, New York, Long Island. He was very monotone when he talked, like a middle-aged white guy.’</p><p>Police later traced the calls which were detected from her deceased sister’s phone at locations including Penn Station in Manhattan, close to Heuermann’s office, and in Massapequa where he resides, according to court documents.</p><p>Recollecting the terrifying phone calls in 2020, Amanda recounted that the killer had insulted her and referred to her sister’s sex work.</p><p>‘He killed Melissa after having sex with her,’ recounted Amanda F. ‘In the final call, he said he’d killed her.’</p><p>A total of seven calls were made to the family, with the final one placed on August 26, 2009. The dates of the calls were disclosed during Heuermann’s criminal arraignment on Friday.</p><p>Barthelemy, a petite blonde woman, was the first of the serial killer’s victims to be found on Ocean Parkway in December 2010. She was an escort who had disappeared from the Bronx the year before.</p><p>The killer left clues including hair strands, burlap used to wrap the bodies, and a belt embossed with possible initials.</p><p>Heuermann was charged with first- and second-degree murder in connection with the deaths of Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello. Authorities also stated he is the ‘prime suspect’ in another killing.</p><p>Barthelemy’s cousin, Amy Brotz, expressed how the arrest reignited anger and grief but also brought the possibility of closure.</p><p>‘I can’t wrap my head around this,’ Brotz said, just hours after the unexpected news of the arrest.</p><p>‘God has brought peace to the families,’ she said. ‘Maybe we can start the healing.’</p><p>While closure might be nearing for Brotz and her family, the ordeal is not over yet. She expressed concerns about the emotional toll and relived trauma that may occur should the case go to trial.</p><p>‘The fact that my family is going to have to sit and listen to all this, to every specific, tiny little detail is making me sick,’ Brotz said.</p><p>The toddler and three other victims have yet to be identified. All 10 adult victims, including the toddler’s mother, were sex workers, according to police.</p><p>Investigators mentioned that Heuermann might not be responsible for all of the deaths. In addition to the Barthelemy case, he has only been accused of killing two others, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello, who were reported missing in 2010.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698712217_183_Suspected-New-York-serial-kller-used-the-mobile-phone-of.jpg><p>He is also the prime suspect in the death of a fourth woman who disappeared three years earlier, Maureen Brainard-Barnes.</p><p>Heuermann asserts his innocence, according to his lawyer.</p><p>If convicted on all charges, Heuermann could face multiple life sentences without the possibility of parole.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqoqukmr9uu8VmraKbpJ66brvFZqquq6CasLWxw2alnq9drryzt4ysnKuhkaF6rLXLpZyrZaKaw6aty6xkraeiorKvwIyonWaekaK2rcWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

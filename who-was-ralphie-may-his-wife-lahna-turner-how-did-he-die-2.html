His&nbsp;body was reportedly found in the morning of the said date at a&nbsp;private residence in Las Vegas, where he was lodging at Harrah’s Las Vegas Hotel and Casino.&nbsp;The comedian had performed there the previous night after&nbsp;several shows which were scheduled to&nbsp;go through the end of the year at the venue were canceled in a bid to allow May recover from&nbsp;pneumonia which he had battled for many weeks. According to his&nbsp;publicist Stacey Pokluda, the cause of his death was&nbsp;cardiac arrest.</p><p>It was reported that hours before he passed on, May was slated to have a&nbsp;meet-and-greet session&nbsp;after his last performance at Harrah’s around midnight, but that was not possible as he showed signs of his worsening health condition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHq4rdJmqZqkoJ22pnnMmrBmoJmoeri1xZ5kpZmYo65uwNSrpZ6qXZ28uHnDoptmoJVisaqxjGtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

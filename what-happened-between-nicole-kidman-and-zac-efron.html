She’s done a lot of things in her career to win awards and the five time Oscar winner would gladly oblige if the role calls for it. One thing in particular that perhaps is still carved on the minds of the critics is her infamous scene with <strong><a href=#>Zac Efron.</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-scene-that-piqued-the-interests-of-the-critics-between-zac-efron-and-nicole-kidman>The Scene That Piqued The Interests Of The Critics Between Zac Efron And Nicole Kidman</h2><p>Nicole Kidman’s portrayal of Charlotte Bless in the film adaptation of Pete Dexter’s thriller novel titled The Paperboy has earned her several nominations and awards. The actress went all out for the role and gave her all for the Lee Daniels film including<a href=#> performing an unbelievable stunt</a> on the film. The film also stars John Cusack, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron.</p><p>The film revolves around the fiery woman named Charlotte Bless who fell in love with John Cusack’s character named Hillary Van Wetter who’s a man on death row.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She enlisted two investigative reporters Jack Jansen and Ward Jansen, played by Efron and McConaughey, to prove his innocence. The film garnered attention at the Cannes Film Festival since it had a lot of interesting scenes however one scene in particular intrigued the critics.</p><p>The scene that piqued everyone’s interest is the clip where Nicole Kidman urinated on Zac Efron’s face. Zac Efron’s character got stung by a jellyfish in the face and a bunch of nurses suggested that urine can relieve the pain. Nicole Kidman’s character jumped right in and started peeing in Efron’s beautiful face. The actress believes that the scene was calling for it, so she just went with it.</p><p>Viewers might wonder if it’s real and Kidman confirmed that it was indeed real. Director Lee instructed her to do it as it was on the script. The actress added that she was glad that it was Efron since she claims that she feels safe and comfortable with him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-most-uncomfortable-scene-zac-efron-had-to-take-with-nicole-kidman>The Most Uncomfortable Scene Zac Efron Had To Take With Nicole Kidman</h2><p>Through the course of Zac Efron’s career, he’s done a lot of embarrassing things, and he’s pretty cool about it. During the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> promotions for the film The Greatest Showman</a>, Zac Efron and Zendaya were invited to an interview for Buzzfeed UK. The pair had to ask each other questions from the set of questionnaires prepared by the Buzzfeed staff.</p><p>As the interview went on, <a href=#>Zendaya who still lives with her parents</a> proceeded to ask Efron what was the most uncomfortable scene that he had to take. With his decades long career, Efron had tons of scenes to choose from; however, he answered a scene that had something to do with one of the most famous actresses in Hollywood, Nicole Kidman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zac Efron started explaining that the most uncomfortable scene he had to take was a scene from the movie he did called The Paperboy.</p><p>For those who have seen the film, the scene where Nicole Kidman peed on Efron would probably be stuck on their minds. Upon hearing that answer, one would probably think about that time she peed on him as the most awkward scene from that film.</p><p>Surprisingly, Efron did not talk about that thing and instead talked about the make out session they had to do. Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman did a hot and heavy scene on the film and Efron believes that it’s a little unbearable to film. Efron said that the scene was mostly improv and their characters was just supposed to hook up, however they never heard the director yell cut, so they just continued what they were doing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added that the two of them just went on with it until they were both slightly undressed and things started to happen. It was a little uncomfortable for him since they weren’t sure when to stop. After doing a love scene with Nicole Kidman, he still can’t believe it and thinks that it was the highlight of his life.</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman-and-zac-efron-s-reunion-after-the-paperboy>Nicole Kidman And Zac Efron's Reunion After The Paperboy</h2><p>Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron haven’t worked together since the film The Paperboy.

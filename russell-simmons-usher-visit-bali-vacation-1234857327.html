Set to Beyoncé’s “Love On Top” the post cycles through images of yoga routines, group photos, and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“When i was at the lowest point in my life i woke up and this man was sitting by my bed .. i had known usher since he was a kid but we really bonded because of our mutual love for self discovery and our belief in Yogic science as a direct route to realizing Gods conciousness in ourselves,” detailed the caption.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“People remember to remember this ..a friend walks in when others walk out … i will never forget the generosity of spirit i witnessed in this man God bless you baby bro.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A second upload hours later shared more footage of the yoga experience with Simmons, Usher, and others.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Morning flow with a bunch of really happy Bali friends the generosity of spirit exuded by my friend&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>@usher</a>&nbsp;was amazing Fyi people were / are always so happy to be in his presence …so when i / they practice with him its a honor and privilege but the presence and attention he gives to each person is a gift its tough to be present with so many of us ” fans,” wrote the <a href=#>66-year-old.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Russell Simmons remains in Bali amid ongoing rape allegations. Simmons is accused of violent sexual behavior or misconduct by more than a dozen women, with several sharing their traumatic stories in the 2020 <a href=#>On The Record</a> documentary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Drew Dixon, a former Def Jam A&R executive who was featured in the film, is <a href=#>currently suing</a> Simmons for defamation for calling her a “liar” after she leveled claims of sexual assault. According to court documents, Simmons “has gone on a concerted and malicious campaign to discredit Ms. Dixon and to so damage her reputation” and “this defamation has exacerbated the paralyzation of Ms. Dixon professionally.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, Simmons is <a href=#>being sued by another</a> woman, a former music producer, who alleges she was raped by the famous music executive under the New York’s Adult Survivors Act and the New York City Gender Motivated Violence Act. In her suit, Jane Doe alleges Simmons made a “wrestling move,” pinned her down on his bed, and proceeded to rape her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1743795493.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In a December 2023 clip from&nbsp;In Depth with Graham Bensinger,&nbsp;Simmons claimed to had taken lie detector tests for each “serious” allegation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I took nine lie detector tests, people don’t know that,” said Simmons. “Nine separate — seven from the Chairman of the Polygraph Association. One for each and serious accusation.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “When someone said, for instance, ‘I was violent’ — one person said that — and I’ve never been violent. Took that. And one said I apologized. I never apologized about assaulting anyone. But if two people say it, because one said it, and #metoo, and the second person said it, then I took a test for it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out the discussion below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6fCtL%2FEpaNmq5miurC60masrKCVp3q3tdKiq2aakaG2bsLAnJitoZ%2BjenJ%2Bkm1vbm9jZ4Rw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

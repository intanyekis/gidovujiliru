As we all know, there's a lot of work that you have to do to maintain a relationship with someone that you love, because things don't always work out.</p><p class=dh>In today's society, we all view some celebrities as "goals." We see their flashy life on social media and the beautiful things they do for one another, and we instantly hold those as the standard.</p><p class=dh>However, as we've been able to find out time and again, things aren't always perfect in these relationships as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a75bb8c2e59516b87508dc773ea80bcd29462651574985923.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rebecca and Tery Crews at Steven Tyler and Live Nation presents Inaugural Janie's Fund Gala & GRAMMY Viewing Party on January 28, 2018. | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>The Terry Crews Story: Not All is Perfect</strong></p><p class=dh>One of the perfect examples of this is Terry Crews. The actor has had a glittering career with a slew of awesome action and comedy roles. Still, one thing that has continuously endeared him to the hearts of people is his relationship with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a66e97ad2c49cc3dd354af667056ac569957191574986062.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rebecca King-Crews and Terry Crews backstage during 2019 ESSENCE Festival on July 05, 2019 | Photo: GettyImages</p><p class=dh>For one, Crews didn't get his big acting break until the early 2000s. All that time, he had to be working odd jobs to keep himself afloat. However, there were also some issues that they faced over time.</p><p class=dh>In <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">an interview with Steve Harvey </a>last year, he explained that he engaged in several destructive behaviors – so much so that his wife left him at a point.</p><p class=dh>When asked what he believed was the key to a successful marriage, Terry answered that he and his wife had broken up a few times. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">He said,</a></p><p class=dh>"There were some times when, basically, I wasn't the perfect man.

He grew up learning to control everything in his life – including his wife and his family. However, he found that it's impossible to control someone you love. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0F3BhonHMM">He continued,</a></p><p class=dh>"And you know what? She put up with me. I'll be honest with you, she put up, she stood in there, and then there was one day when she was like, 'I'm out.'"</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>Merging Family with Business</strong></p><p class=dh>Terry firmly holds on to the belief that he can't love someone and control them at the same time.

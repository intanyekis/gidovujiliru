I wouldn’t be the person to confirm it after all. But the fact is that whether I talk about it or not, the truth will eventually come out. I wouldn’t be the one to come out and tarnish her name and if I wanted to discuss our family issues, I would have done that a long time ago. The truth is out there. It’s hard to fight it. I wish her all the best,” he told the daily.</p><p>Owen opened up about his failed marriage stating that at some point their relationship was so strained that he would sometimes lock himself up in the house and cried for hours.</p><p>“We have been discussing our issues as a couple and consulting when things don’t go right. We haven’t been agreeing on everything and that is human. However, when one wrong leads to another, you really have to get concerned and start thinking hard. When it came to that, I fell into depression and could lock myself in the house and cry, asking God why this was going on.</p><p>“I stopped writing and releasing songs, as my creativity wasn’t working. I could not pray, as I felt weak inside. I contemplated doing everything wrong, even death. Nothing in life makes sense. The worst bit is that everyone out there thinks you have it all put together and life is progressive,” he continued.</p><p>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>I’ve Been Depressed For Three Years – Daddy Owen Says After Marriage Allegedly Falls Apart</a></p><p>Asked if he and Wambui are getting a divorce, the award-winning singer responded with a Bible verse.</p><p>“There is only one main ground for divorce in the Bible.

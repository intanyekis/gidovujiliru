When he didn’t receive the type of response he was searching for, he revealed intimate details of their relationship in a <a href=#>leaked audio</a>.</p><p>Although Sparks put that occurrence&nbsp;behind her, another old relationship has returned. One of her first public partnerships was with fellow singer <a href=# id=auto-tag_jason-derulo_1 data-tag=jason-derulo>Jason Derulo</a>. The pair broke up in 2014, but two years later Derulo is speaking out on their split.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>xoNecole</a>, the “Trumpets” singer said. “Things could’ve been different had different choices been made from her side. I felt some kind of way because the world thought it was my fault, and I broke up with her.”</p><p>He later continued, “So they kind of fu**ed with me only from that perspective. I was really disappointed in her and how she handled it because she made people believe that it was my fault. Like Wendy Williams asked her, ‘so we heard that he cheated, is that why you guys broke up?’ and she says, ‘No comment.’ Like what the f**k you mean no comment ?!”</p><p>The Miami native also remained on the topic of the American Idol winner after a certain line on his song “Naked” was called into question. “The only time I need the sparks is when I light up my spliffs,” he sings. In response to that lyric, Derulo said, “You think that’s shade? I say some other sh*t they’re really going to think is shade,” in reference to his pending album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2ButLvNZpueqqWhvG62zquboqZdqL2ivsqsZJuqlZa4bsHPZmtpcWVtgnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

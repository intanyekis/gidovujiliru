In fact, she would even land her first starring role just a few years later.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emilia Clarke Shares Her Thoughts On HBO's New 'Game Of Thrones' Prequel Series</a></span></p><p>In the hit Starz history drama The Spanish Princess, Hope portrayed Catherine of Aragon. Throughout its two seasons, the show received some critical praise, largely due to Hope’s performance.</p><p>What’s more, the series also helped establish the actress as a lead star. And more importantly, it seems The Spanish Princess had done wonders for her net worth.</p><h2 id=charlotte-hope-worked-to-establish-herself-after-game-of-thrones>Charlotte Hope Worked To Establish Herself After Game Of Thrones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Charlotte-Hope-as-Sister-Victoria-in-The-Nun-via-IMDb.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following her Game of Thrones stint, Hope found herself venturing into films. She booked a supporting role in the 2016 Oscar-nominated film Allied, which stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.</p><p>In the film, Hope plays Louise, a woman who plays the cello just like the actress in real life. Hope maintains that this aspect of her character was purely “coincidental.” “I played it, when, a lot when I was younger and it’s one of those such a beautiful instrument,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Female First</a>. “It’s kind of the few things I’ve kept up.”</p><p>Soon after, Hope also reunited with Game of Thrones co-star Pete Dinklage in the drama Three Christs. The film also stars Richard Gere and Bradley Whitford. In the film, Gere plays a doctor treating three paranoid schizophrenic patients (including Dinklage and Whitford) who all believe that they are Jesus Christ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These 'Game Of Thrones' Actors Couldn't Be In The Same Room Together</a></span></p><p>The following year, Hope appeared in the horror film The Nun where she plays Sister Victoria. <a href=#>Partly based on a true story</a>, The Nun expounds on the story of Valek, an evil nun first seen in The Conjuring 2.</p><p>As it turns out, the actress had been a fan of The Conjuring universe long before she booked the part.</p><p>“I remember that shot in The Conjuring 2 where there's that painting, and you don't know if it's a painting and then it's her. That is scary stuff; she really freaked me out for a long time,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope told Female</a>.</p><p>“And now to have a movie that explains her…that's a fascinating prospect.”</p><h2 id=charlotte-hope-sent-lsquo-a-ton-rsquo-of-tapes-to-land-the-spanish-princess-role>Charlotte Hope Sent ‘A Ton’ Of Tapes To Land The Spanish Princess Role</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After some time, it seemed that Hope was ready to return to episodic television once more. And that was when The Spanish Princess came along.</p><p>When the actress heard that auditions were ongoing, she knew she had to do what she could to stand out.</p><p>“I was doing a play so I was making self-tape after self-tape after self-tape and I did extra self-tapes in Spanish and that thing of being like, ‘I’m gonna do two extra scenes just to show how much I love it,’ which usually people read as desperation,” Hope explained during an interview with Gold Derby.</p><p>“Maybe it is, maybe it isn’t, but still, I think it worked. A ton of self-tapes and then I actually just got cast off the tapes.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here Is Everything We Know About 'The Conjuring' House That's Now On Sale For $1.2 Million</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In some ways, becoming the Spanish princess was also a full-circle moment for Hope. The series is a follow-up to The White Queen and The White Princess and Hope has long wanted to be involved with the ‘franchise.’</p><p>“I auditioned for The White Queen, and when I didn’t get it, I was hysterically crying,” she revealed while speaking with W Magazine. “Then I watched The White Princess because I’m obsessed with Jodie. She’s also a friend of mine, but I’m obsessed.”</p><p>Hope later remarked, “How’s that for dramatic irony ultimately working out in, well, everyone’s favor?”</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-the-spanish-princess-has-done-for-charlotte-hope-rsquo-s-net-worth>Here’s What The Spanish Princess Has Done For Charlotte Hope’s Net Worth</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hope’s continuous stint in Hollywood has certainly put the actress in a better financial position. Back in 2018, the actress was only reportedly worth a modest $850,000.</p><p>Since landing the lead role in The Spanish Princess, however, Hope’s net worth has reportedly gone up to as much as $8 million. It stands to reason that her salary from her most recent series was partly responsible for bringing the figure up, although her rate per episode was never disclosed.</p><p>Meanwhile, following The Spanish Princess, it seems Hope continues to be on a roll. In fact, the actress has already been attached to three film projects so far.</p><p>These include the horror movie The Piper, the crime drama entitled The Chelsea Cowboy, and a thriller entitled The Hiker.</p><p>At the moment, it is unclear if Hope would also be willing to do more series work. Considering how The Spanish Princess had worked out nicely for her though, it’s safe to say that she’ll take on another show if the right one comes along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Where Is ‘Game Of Thrones’ Star Jack Gleeson Now?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoZmioby1wMRmn6iolWK7psCMsKarrJhiwLGtzaKqoWWgp7avr8Ssqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

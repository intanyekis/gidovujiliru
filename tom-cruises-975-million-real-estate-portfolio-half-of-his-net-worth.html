He's responsible for being the face of one of the most popular action spy film series, Mission Impossible, which is a $4.09 billion film franchise. As the lead actor in all of those movies, Tom Cruise's net worth has to be more than a pretty penny - try $600 million.</p><p>Aside from the total grossing for the Mission Impossible franchise, Tom Cruise's movies when combined have grossed over $11.5 billion worldwide. But as any other prestigious actor in Hollywood, Cruise started small and steadily worked his way up the ladder, earning weightier paychecks as his stature grew in the entertainment industry. Besides his $97.5 million real estate portfolio, let's find out what else makes up Tom Cruise's net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-tom-cruise-39-s-real-estate-portfolio-worth-97-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Why Is Tom Cruise's Real Estate Portfolio Worth $97.5 Million?</span></h2><h3 id=greatest-real-estate-purchase-30-5-million>Greatest Real Estate Purchase: $30.5 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tom-cruise.jpg><p>Tom Cruise's real estate portfolio may be just as extensive and expensive as his movie career, even though it doesn't even account for half of his entire net worth. And while it may not compare to <a href=#>Jack Nicholson's massive portfolio</a>, $97.5 million is still quite a hefty price for only real estate purchases. For most ultra rich celebrities, it's more manageable to invest their millions into things like properties and stocks in larger companies because they often yield a greater return on their investment.

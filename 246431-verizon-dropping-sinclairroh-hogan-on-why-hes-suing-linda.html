Then, all of a sudden she says I abused her, that I was violent. She told everybody that I was a homosexual. If any of that was true, I would admit it, and I was a homosexual I would embrace it. It's just so crazy to hear, so I have a real problem with it….If you're going to say I'm something that I'm not to try to ruin my career and my livelihood….I have to answer her back."

Although we have tried very hard to get a deal done with Verizon, Verizon is refusing to pay what we believe is a fair rate for the right to carry our stations. Verizon FIOS apparently thinks that its subscribers won't care if they no longer carry our great programming – apparently they aren't wrestling fans! – and perhaps the only thing that will change their mind is hearing from their customers.</p><p>We know you are a wrestling fan and if you are also a FIOS subscriber we strongly encourage you to call them at 1-800-VERIZON (1-800-837-4966) to let them know you will cancel your subscription if they stop carrying our stations and Ring of Honor.</p><p>We also ask that you contact as many of your family and friends as possible and ask them to contact Verizon as well. By doing this you may influence Verizon to act more reasonably and continue to carry ROH plus all of our other great programming that we are sure you enjoy watching.</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpNva2xpXauys7XZqKVmnKKkvbG1zaBkrKGemLmitdGrpqFlmKS0orqMqKVmr5iueqmx0maqrqGenHqttc2dmA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He has been my dear companion for over 12 years, and they have been wonderful years. Our split is very amicable. Our reasons are very personal.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>The 46-year-old writer detailed the beginning of their love story in her 2006 memoir. After her divorce from her first husband, </span><b>Michael Cooper</b><span>, she embarked on a journey around the world where she found comfort by eating in Italy, praying in India and finding peace and love in Indonesia. Toward the end of her adventure in Bali, she met a Brazilian businessman with whom she fell in love.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><i>Eat, Pray, Love</i><span> later became a film in 2010. </span><b>Julia Roberts</b><span> starred as Gilbert alongside a star-studded cast, including </span><b>Billy Crudup</b><span>, </span><b>Viola Davis</b><span>, </span><b>James Franco</b><span> and </span><b>Javier Bardem</b><span>, who played Felipe.</span></p><p>“At this time of transition, I hope you will respect our privacy,” she continued on Facebook on Friday. “In my heart, I know that you will do so, because I trust that you understand how this is a story that I am living — not a story that I am telling.”</p><p>In similar <i>Eat, Pray, Lov</i>e fashion, she explained that she’s taking a break from social media. “I thank you for your love, and for your kindness, and for your continued blessings,” she said. “Hold us in your thoughts. And I hope you will understand and forgive me if I am a bit absent from social media during this sensitive moment.”</p><p>Gilbert also shared a poem by <b>Jack Gilbert</b> (no relation to the <i>Big Magic</i> author) called “Failing and Flying,” about a failed marriage. “Anything worth doing is worth doing badly,” one line from the poem reads.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaemaRivbOt2GajqK6VYq62wMeoqWadnJ7Hoq7ErZ9mn5mhr6a%2B02aqqaSZqcBustGopGagpaivorrDZq5raWFuf3F7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

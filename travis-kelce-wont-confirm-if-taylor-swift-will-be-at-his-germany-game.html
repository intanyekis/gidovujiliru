So I don’t want to mess with any of that stuff,” he joked. “I’m just going to keep that to myself.”</p><p class=p3>Kelce <a href=#>has been linked to Swift, 33, since September</a> after initially <a href=#>failing to exchange phone numbers</a> via friendship bracelet during her July <i><a href=#>Eras Tour</a> </i>stop in Missouri. Amid <a href=#>their blossoming romance</a>, the Grammy winner has attended four of Kelce’s games — and watched him win each one.</p><p class=p3>After <a href=#>the Chiefs’ victory over the Los Angeles Chargers</a> on October 22, <a href=#>NFL broadcasters even pointed out</a> that Kelce has fared better when Swift was spotted in the crowds versus when he’s “left to his own devices.” (The latter being a reference to her 2022 song “Anti-Hero.”) Per CBS, Kelce has gained 99 yards per game with Swift in the stands as compared to a mere 46.5 whenever she skipped one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Jokes-Confirming-Taylor-Swift-s-Chiefs-Game-Attendance-Affects-His-Football-Stats-inline.jpg><p class=p3>“Taylor was in attendance and it’s turning out it was good she was in attendance because they put your stats up — when she’s at the game, when she is not at the game. I don’t know if you’re aware of this,” Travis’ brother, <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, later <a href=#>recalled during an episode</a> of their “New Heights” podcast.</p><p class=p3>Travis succinctly replied, “How could I not be aware of this? … ‘Left to his own devices.’ Well put.”</p><p class=p3>A source previously <a href=#>confirmed to </a><i><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </i>that Swift would not step out at all of Travis’ upcoming games because she doesn’t want to be a “distraction” to him.</p><p class=p3>“She knows it’s not easy when she shows up to his games. It’s a spectacle,” the source told <i>Us </i>last month. “She wants to support him and strike a balance while, at the same time, not be distracting to the team.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>Swift ultimately <a href=#>skipped the Chiefs’ matchup against the Denver Broncos</a> on October 29, in which they lost. After Travis licked his wounds, Swifted <a href=#>jetted to his side</a> to console him. Travis teased their meetup — which <a href=#>coincided with Halloween</a> — during his Friday press conference.</p><p class=p3>“The latest status is <a href=#>I got to see her last week</a>. That’s the latest status right there,” he told reporters in Germany when asked if he was falling in love with Swift. “I’m going to keep my personal relationship personal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1drLyvwIycpqeemae6brXFZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWnnrmtecGeZJqsXZ22tHnGnqmmmZ6ueqitzJ5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

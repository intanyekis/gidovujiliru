Friends was a hit TV show in the 90s that was focused on a group of six adults in their late 20s, trying to navigate through life in New York City when it came to dating, friendship, employment, and more. The Geller family added a lot of interesting moments to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>If it wasn’t for the hilarious Geller parents on friends, we wouldn’t understand why Ross and Monica turned out the way that they did. There are a few things about this family unit they don’t really make a lot of sense. For example, the fact that Monica dated one of her dad’s best friends is super weird. Most families cannot relate to a situation as awkward as that. Continue reading to find out everything else that doesn’t make sense about this family.</p><h2 id=would-jack-and-judy-make-it-so-obvious-that-they-favor-ross-over-monica-irl><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Would&nbsp;Jack And Judy Make It So Obvious That They Favor Ross Over Monica IRL?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack-judy.jpg><p class=p1>It’s common knowledge that parents are not supposed to show favoritism between their kids! That’s why it’s so weird and interesting that Jack and Judy Geller made it obvious that they prefer Ross over Monica. For example, they accepted all of the women that Ross chooses to date but always criticized the men Monica dates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ross-claimed-to-not-like-ice-cream-but-he-s-seen-eating-it-later-on-with-marcel><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Ross Claimed To Not Like Ice Cream But He's Seen Eating It Later On With Marcel</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ross-1.jpg><p class=p1>Ross makes the claim that he doesn’t like eating ice cream because it’s too cold for his teeth but later on, we end up seeing him eating ice cream!

That is why it is pretty shocking that Monika decided to open her wedding gifts without Chandler by her side.

It is also revealed that he was drunk during that time, so maybe he just didn’t remember hooking up with her.</p><h2 id=monica-would-never-have-a-secret-clutter-closet><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Monica&nbsp;Would NEVER Have&nbsp;A Secret Clutter Closet</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/friends3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Monica is a neat-freak who cares about keeping everything as tidy as possible, no matter what.

The wedding is only one day out of an entire lifetime so the fact that she was so pushy towards the idea of him spending his savings on the wedding is kind of messed up.

He mentioned the fact that he was 29 multiple times and it caused quite a bit of confusion for viewers. We are wondering just how old Ross really was? There is no way that he remained 29 for that long!</p><h2 id=monica-prefers-fun-bobby-when-he-s-under-the-influence><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Monica Prefers Fun Bobby When He's Under The Influence</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/friends4.jpg><p class=p1>Monica used to date Fun Bobby when he was a party guy who liked drinking but when she reconnected with him later on, she didn’t like him anymore due to his sobriety.

The fact that Ross did this is pretty messed up, to be honest.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross Geller Is A Total D-Bag (Here’s 15 Reasons Why)</a></span></p><h2 id=monica-flirts-with-soap-opera-actors-after-marrying-chandler><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Monica Flirts With Soap Opera Actors After Marrying Chandler</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/monica.jpg><p class=p1>Monica Geller flirted with soap opera actors… After she married Chandler.

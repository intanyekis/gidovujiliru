All double taps and no dm. Soooo after a little liquid courage and a pep talk from @iqueenb (something along the lines of ‘WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR’) I dm’d him on New Years,” Kayla posted on her Instagram Story.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kayla Nicole opened up Tuesday on Instagram about her relationship with boyfriend Travis Kelce <span class=credit>Instagram/Kayla Nicole</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kayla shared in an Instagram Story how she slid into Kelce’s DMs <span class=credit>Instagram/Kayla Nicole</span></figure><p>“Slid into that thang like it was third base, idk baseball so not sure that’s the best analogy, but ya,” she continued in a separate Instagram Story. “Anywho … lesson here is making the first move might be your best move sis.”</p><p>Kayla, 30, and Kelce, 32, were first linked in 2017. Although <a href=#>they briefly split</a> in the summer of 2020, they reunited later that year and have been together ever since.</p><p>Recently, the couple jetted to Hawaii <a href=#>for Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Matthews’ lavish nuptials</a>, with Kayla serving as a bridesmaid and Kelce as a groomsman. When asked about the wedding by a fan on Instagram, Kayla called the affair “pure perfection.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kelce during the Chiefs-Bills playoff game in January 2022 <span class=credit>Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</span></figure><p>“Also, @brittanylynne was the most chill and stunning bride. omg,” Kayla wrote in a post on Tuesday.</p><p>Prior to Matthews and Mahomes’ big day, Kelce <a href=#>flew to Las Vegas</a> for his Chiefs teammate’s bachelor party, while Kayla <a href=#>joined the Kansas City Current co-owner</a> in Miami for her bachelorette bash.</p><p>Much like Matthews, Kayla is typically present at Chiefs games during the season.

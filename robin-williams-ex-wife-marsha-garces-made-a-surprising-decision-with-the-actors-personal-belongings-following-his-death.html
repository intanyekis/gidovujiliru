In addition, Garces kept some of Williams' prized items following his passing. Among those pieces of memorabilia included his Hollywood Walk of Fame star. According to Daily Mail, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">four years after Robin's death, the items were auctioned off</a>.</p><p>The publication writes, "Among items that will go under the gauntlet is a Frank Muller watch that is expected to fetch up to $35,000 and a robe worn by Daniel Radcliffe on the set of Harry Potter which is being sold for between $10,000 and $15,000. Williams' star from the Walk of Fame is likely to fetch up to $5,000 and other items, including pieces of furniture and books, are priced similarly."</p><p>Daily Mail continues that the most expensive piece was actually a wooden horse sculpture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar49144742.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/robin-williams-looking-emotional.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Robin Williams’ Secret Struggles With Substances Revealed A Decade After His Death">Robin Williams’ Secret Struggles With Substances Revealed A Decade After His Death</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Robin's' friends claim he suffered with addiction for years, especially during his initial years in Hollywood.</p><p>Although the items went to auction, it should be noted that the profits did not go to Williams' ex, and instead, were given to charity.

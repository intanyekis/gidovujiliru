They've experienced tremendous success on film and television, and as supporting characters in blockbuster films like Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Interstellar (2014), but it was the first installment in the Dune franchise that truly solidified them as box office draws.</p><p>The 2021 epic grossed $433 million worldwide and was nominated for ten Oscars including Best Picture. The anticipation for the second installment in the franchise, Dune: Part Two, is at an all-time high, and as such, <strong>Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet secured massive paydays</strong> for their leading performances.</p><p>The following article will detail the pay raises that <a href=#>both actors</a> received between Dune films, and how their salaries compare to the rest of the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zendaya-and-timothee-chalamet-are-set-to-make-millions-for-dune-part-two>Zendaya And Timothee Chalamet Are Set To Make Millions For Dune: Part Two</h2><p>Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet have incredibly dedicated followings, and have proven themselves to be tastemakers for younger generations of moviegoers. It should then come as no surprise that the actors were given the two biggest salaries out of the impressive ensemble cast that makes up Dune: Part Two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/zendaya-chalamet-photoshoot.jpg><p>According to Showbiz Galore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Zendaya is getting paid $2 million</strong> for her role</a> as Chani Kynes, and <strong>Chalamet is getting paid $3 million</strong> for his performance as the film's hero, Paul Atriedes. These are not only impressive salaries on their own, but they are two of only three Dune: Part Two salaries that break the $1 million mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast for Dune: Part Two includes box office draws like Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista, Oscar winners like Javier Bardem and Christopher Walken, as well as rising stars like Austin Butler and Florence Pugh.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_zendaya-s-insane-movie-and-tv-show-salaries-have-changed-her-net-worth-forever_bk_a1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically">Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Shows like Zapped and HBO's Euphoria, as well as blockbusters like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dune, have made Zendaya a very rich woman.</p><p>A quick look at the salaries for Dune: Part Two confirms just how much Warner Bros. values the contributions of Zendaya and Chalamet:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Actor</p></td><td><p>Dune: Part Two Salary (According To Showbiz Galore)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Timothee Chalamet</p></td><td><p>$3 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zendaya</p></td><td><p>$2 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dave Bautista</p></td><td><p>$1 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rebecca Ferguson</p></td><td><p>$600,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Josh Brolin</p></td><td><p>$500,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Florence Pugh</p></td><td><p>$300,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Austin Butler</p></td><td><p>$250,000</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These figures are predicated on multiple different factors, including star power and screen time. Bautista and Rebecca Ferguson are recognizable names, but they don't drum up the hype that Zendaya and Chalamet do. They will also appear on-screen much less than the leading couple, who will drive nearly every scene in the film.</p><h2 id=zendaya-and-timothee-chalamet-both-received-pay-increases-after-the-success-of-dune-part-one>Zendaya And Timothee Chalamet Both Received Pay Increases After The Success Of Dune: Part One</h2><p>Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet were still on the rise when they were cast in the first Dune film. The former had just won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in Euphoria (2019-), and the latter was the third-youngest person to ever be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Call Me By Your Name (2017).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chalamet-zendaya-dune-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, Warner Bros. was unsure if the heady science fiction epic would do blockbuster numbers, so the salaries for both actors were lower. Chalamet was paid $2 million for his performance in the first film, according to Showbiz Galore, and Zendaya was paid the shockingly low amount of $300K.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Actor</p></td><td><p>Dune: Part One Salary</p></td><td><p>Dune: Part Two Salary (According To Showbiz Galore)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zendaya</p></td><td><p>$300,000</p></td><td><p>$2 Million</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>T. Chalamet</p></td><td><p>$2 Million</p></td><td><p>$3 Million</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>While it may appear strange in retrospect, given how important Zendaya is to the appeal of the franchise and the plot of the second film, the decision to pay her so much less than her co-star was due to the fact that she only appeared on-screen for seven minutes in Dune: Part One.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zendaya was only on the set of the film for four days, according to Empire, which means she was paid $75k per day. Not bad work if you can get it. Some fans were disappointed to learn that she was in such a small chunk of Dune: Part One, but Zendaya assured them that she would play a much greater role in the sequel.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_the-truth-about-tom-holland-and-zendaya-s-relationship_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Tom Holland And Zendaya's Relationship ">The Truth About Tom Holland And Zendaya's Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans loved the idea of Tom Holland and Zendaya together even when they denied they were a couple.</p><p>Zendaya went as far as to tell Total Film that she was the co-lead of Dune: Part Two, which makes sense given her significant bump in salary:</p><p>"[The film is] really able to build out a strong sense of [Chani’s] own views and life. I did feel a particular sense of care for what Chani represents."</p><h2 id=zendaya-and-timothee-chalamet-have-already-agreed-to-appear-in-a-third-dune-film>Zendaya And Timothee Chalamet Have Already Agreed To Appear In A Third Dune Film</h2><p>Zendaya and Timothee Chalamet are the most consequential names attached to the Dune franchise, and as such, the plan for additional films is dependent on their involvement. Given how much acclaim both actors have received for their performances, it would be an uphill battle to recast them. Fortunately, for fans, Zendaya and Chalamet are eager to return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/zendaya-chalamet-red-carpet.jpg><p>During a red carpet interview, Zendaya confirmed that she would be interested in reprising her character for an adaptation of the third Dune book, Dune: Messiah:</p><p>"Would we be down? I mean, of course. I’m excited to see what happens."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chalamet was similarly excited</a> when Total Film asked him about the future of the franchise.</p><p>"The idea excites me very much," he noted. "I think we're all super-enthusiastic about that." The possibility of a third Dune film is predicated on the success of the second film, but, as is the case with any popular franchise, more films means higher salaries for the main stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kylie-jenner-and-timothee-chalamet.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kylie Jenner Allegedly Has Strict List Of Rules For Timothee Chalamet As She’s Suspicious Of His Exes ">Kylie Jenner Allegedly Has Strict List Of Rules For Timothee Chalamet As She’s Suspicious Of His Exes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kylie reportedly expects Timothee to give her his passwords and locations after being cheated on in past relationships.</p><p>Zendaya and Chalamet are already sitting pretty thanks to the sizable paydays they've gotten from Dune: Part Two.

In this unprecedented, never-before-seen move, many believed Scarlett to be biting the hand that feeds her, while others simply believed she was executing her right as an artist and as a businesswoman. Whatever your take and perspective on this situation, the fact remains that Johansson feels she was unfairly treated and is holding Disney accountable for their break of contract. With litigation already in progress, information is rising to the surface, indicating just how much money Johansson stands to recoup if this lawsuit goes her way, and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the numbers are staggering.</a> According to<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Forbes,</a> her settlement and the fair payout could be in the range of an astonishing $50 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Widow Will Set The Scene For Scarlett Johansson's Permanent Replacement</a></span></p><p>The situation between Scarlett Johansson and Disney is quickly heating up. The two sides remain incredibly divided, and there seems to be no easy way to bridge the gap aside from letting this lawsuit see itself through.</p><p>After playing the role of Black Widow, a number of times on-screen, this movie offered Johansson her very first opportunity to launch her character as the leading role. She agreed to take on the Black Widow leading role and, of course, negotiated a contract with Disney until it was to her liking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scarlett claims she entered into the agreement with them on the basis that she would receive a certain amount of money as a lump sum payout, and a portion of which was based on box office sales. It was then promised to her that this movie was going to be exclusively released, meaning it would be shown to theatres only, thus <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">increasing box office earnings</a> and her overall profits.</p><p>Instead, Disney simultaneously released Black Widow to theaters and to Disney+ live streaming, prompting Johansson to fight for her lost revenues.</p><p>Those lost revenues happen to be significant. According to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, it was declared on "Disney’s own self-congratulatory press release, that the picture grossed more than $60 million on Disney+ Premier Access in its first weekend alone.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scarlett Johansson earned a cool $20 million from Black Widow, but in spite of the fact that<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> this is a very lucrative paycheck</a>, Forbes indicates that she is losing out on roughly $50 million due to the movie's release on Disney +. It is estimated that the $50 million loss is what she would have been paid had the streaming access not been granted, as that would have forced attendees to purchase tickets from the box office in order to view the film.</p><p>The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit remains ongoing,</a> and fans across the globe are tuned in to see how these details unfold.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Out Of The Billionaires' Club: Why Forbes Dropped Kylie Jenner From The Billionaires' List</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Youtube</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTApK3RpZytrF2fvKmtzayqqKZdq8BusMispZ6xXZ28uHnMrpqhZaekwq2wjK2fnmWRmMGzsdKsZKaZm5p6qrKMrJ%2BeZaeeu7R506GcZqSRrMC2tdNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

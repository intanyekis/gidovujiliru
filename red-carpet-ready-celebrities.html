Paparazzi and fans are always anxious to snap your picture (and then post it on social media for millions to see) and you can't even make a simple grocery store run without getting noticed. While the attention can be nice, it also comes along with a large amount of pressure to <a href=#>look flawless at all times.</a></p><p>Celebrities spend a lot (and we're talking <strong>a lot</strong>) of money on looking good. This includes shelling out cash on stylists, <a href=#>personal trainers</a> and make-up artists, to name just a few. Here's a look at just how much money we're talking about.</p><h2 id=kim-kardashian-s-price>Kim Kardashian's Price</h2><p>It's no secret that the <a href=#>Kardashian</a>-Jenner family spends a lot of time getting prepped. According to <a href=#>The Sun</a>, Kim Kardashian spends an estimated $165,500 a<strong> month</strong> on her looks. In order to maintain her notorious figure, Kim trains with celebrity trainer Melissa Alcantara six days a week for two hours at a time. Although Melissa's fee may be much more, it is well known that some celebrity fitness trainers charge up to $2,500 per week for personal training sessions. Kim has worked with make-up artists Mario Dedivanovic and Ariel Tejada for years. Their full day fee can cost up to $2,500. For her hair, Kim relies on celebrity hairstylists Chris Appleton and Andrew Fitz Simons who charge $2,000 a day. Her manicures and pedicures, which she gets done every 10 days, cost $500 and her brows, which are shaped by the "Eyebrow Queen" herself, Anastasia Soare, can cost up to $1,200 if Anastasia is making a house call and, for Kim, she does. Kim has shared the skincare products she uses at home on her website and app and, if you total them up, you'll get to $5,000. For additional skin treatments, Kim will go to Dr. Kanodia's Medspa where facials cost up to $7,600 per treatment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-price>Kylie Jenner's Price</h2><p>Kylie, the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner's spends $141,500 a month on hair, nails and more as reported by <a href=#>The Sun</a>. Kylie is no stranger to switching up her look and those switches mostly happen with her hair. Her regular hair stylist is Tokyo Stylez who charges approximately $2,000 a day for house visits and up to $5,000 for wigs. Kylie also loves a hair extension and it has been reported that she's spent up to $8,000 to get them put in. For her nails, Kylie has frequented Modern Pamper salon in Los Angeles every week for a $100 manicure and pedicure. Her lashes are done by Yris Palmer, one of LA's best lash technicians who charges $170 per appointment - <a href=#>Kylie</a> goes to her twice a month. In terms of surgery, Kylie has shared that she's had filler in her lips and face. Surgeons have reported to <a href=#>Mirror</a> that they estimate that she's spent over $38,000 on additional procedures, including a nose re-shaping.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Items Kylie Jenner Has In Her Closet, Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you've seen an episode of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> at any point over the last five years, you've seen Erika Girardi's glam squad. She basically doesn't go anywhere without them. Erika has previously shared that she spends $40,000 a month on glam. We're talking <a href=#>hair</a>, make-up, wardrobe and stylists. After all, someone has to manage the high-fashion brands and multiple pairs of&nbsp;Christian Louboutin pumps that basically exclusively fill her closest.</p><h2 id=the-actual-carpet>The Actual Carpet</h2><p>Keep in mind that sometimes all this money is spent and all this prep is done to do something as simple as going to lunch. For an actual red carpet event such as&nbsp;the <a href=#>Golden Globes</a>, <a href=#>New York Post</a> estimated that it costs upwards of $44,000 for an actress to get ready. First you need a stylist, not just for the night of the event, but for several days leading up to it. For just that alone, you're looking at a charge of $1,500 a day. Depending on who and what an actress is wearing, the designer may fly their own couture-trained tailors to wherever the event is taking place. If they're flying from Europe, flights can cost around $1,500 and that tailor is going to need a hotel room for a few days. Then there's hair, which is also a multi-day process since hairstylists have to look at their client's dress and then pull inspiration from books and past looks to present to said client. Chris McMillan, who is the man behind Jennifer Aniston's notorious "Rachel" haircut, has styled both <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> and Julianne Moore for the Globes and his day rate is $2,000. Make-up can cost up to $5,000 and nails up to $300 for a house call. Most <a href=#>jewelry</a> that you see on a red carpet is on loan, meaning the celebrity who gets to wear it doesn't pay for all those diamonds. However, costs are still involved. Celebrities are sometimes lent $530,000 worth of jewels for red carpet events and all that glitz and glam has to be insured and protected. In addition to paying for the jewelry to be insured, it has to be delivered to fittings and then the event via armored trucks and security guards are hired to keep a close watch. Those expenses can climb up to $20,000. So the jewelry, although on loan, isn't exactly free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There's obviously a high price to looking good, but celebrities seem more than able to keep up.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Kris Jenner's Journey To Making Herself & Her Family Multi-Millionaires</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>Mirror</a>, <a href=#>People</a>, <a href=#>New York Post</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2FprCMnJirqJWperOxwJ2wZpuVobKjvsitoJ6rXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

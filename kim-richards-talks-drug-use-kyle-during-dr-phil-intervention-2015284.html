Beleaguered Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star <strong>Kim Richards </strong>admitted to drug use during her heated intervention with<strong> Dr. Phil</strong>, which aired Tuesday, April 28.</p><p>The reality star, who was arrested earlier this month for public intoxication at the swanky Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel, walked out on Dr. Phil during the interview after he struck a sensitive note. “Here’s your microphone, I’m done. F— him. I’m leaving,” Richards said as she stormed off. “He just totally put me on the spot with all of these people.” (It remains unclear which “people” Richards was referring to during the interview.)</p><p>After Richards’ abrupt departure, Dr. Phil told her kids that it was best if they spoke to their mom about what had just transpired. “So, what you have to do is not let her back up from this.” The cameras then followed Richards’ three kids — <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Brooke, Kimberly</strong>, and <strong>Chad</strong></a> — back to the hotel room, where they pleaded with their mother to seek professional help.</p><p>From behind closed doors, the cameras caught audio of Richards’ conversations with her children. “You haven’t been sober,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Chad told his mother</a>, who sniped back: “Yeah, but Chad. I’m not drinking everyday.”</p><p>“I live with you,” Chad retorted. “I’m not saying you’re drinking, but you’re taking pills. You do this every once in a while, you smoke pot.”</p><p>She confirmed: “Every once in a while….”</p><p>Before the stormy portion of her intervention, Kim also admitted to pouring herself vodka before her recent arrest, in addition to taking unprescribed pain pills, which have been causing her erratic behavior on the show. “I’m angry,” she told Dr. Phil, adding that her relationship with her sister has not been helping her case.</p><p>“Let me remind you that it isn’t the blog or the season that upset me. It was the relationship with my sister,” she told him, breaking down. “And my niece — that’s been destroyed. Yeah, the mean comments got to me. It’s the overall outcome of where my relationships are with the people that I love the most. And that’s what started getting me upset the most.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Kim-Kyle-042815.jpg><p>Richards added that she was ashamed of her arrest. “I know I’ve put a huge dent in the work that I’ve worked so hard to build over the past few years,” she told Dr. Phil. “I just want to do the right thing and I want to be the strongest I can be. I know that me sober, I can handle almost anything.”</p><p>At the end of the episode, Dr. Phil explained that while Richards initially refused to accept help, she later decided to move forward and check into rehab. “One day later, we received a phone call that Kim had slept on it, searched her heart, and decided to accept this life-changing gift,” he noted, adding that her decision oscillated in the following days. “But then, she went back and forth again. Wanting to choose the rehab, wanting the private room.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Without knowing the ultimate outcome, Dr. Phil simply noted that “it <a href=# rel=noopener>had been reported</a> that Kim had finally decided to check into rehab.” He added: “We certainly hope that’s true and we wish Kim the best.”</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKipV2ntqS0wKubrGWklrmsv4ydqa6fXarApnnKsqOeZZSqv6q6xmabq2Wgnbatecinq56qppq7tbXOp2RraGFqf3mAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

However, for this iteration of the reality show, her marriage will be the point of focus.</p><h2>The Season Will Revolve Around Meredith Marks' Failing Marriage</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Bravo fans held their breath for what seems like forever since the spin-off series was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> at BravoCon 2019. They now have an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">official trailer</a> and a tonne of backstory drama to catch up on. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for Marks, she is supposed to be either the villain or a peacemaker this coming season.&nbsp;</p><p>With her party-girl attitude, Nicki Swift reported that she is often hanging out and having fun with fellow castmates Jen Shah and Lisa Barlow. Since the Meredith Marks dimension of the show is set to revolve around her marital problems, the viewers are in for a season for spicy drama and a lot of bickering.&nbsp;</p><h2>Meredith Marks Has Been Married For 25 Years</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Marks was a Jewish woman who later went on to become a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mormon</a> on her own accord and has managed to stay married for 25 years with husband Seth Stock. The couple even had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three kids</a> together: two sons named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Reid Marks</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brook Marks</a>; and a daughter named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chloe Marks</a>. But now that the kids are off to college, the extravagant couple is running into marital problems. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As Bravo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">put</a> it, the ice queen has it all but when push comes to shove and the rumors start to swirl, she is left with but two choices: turn to her girlfriends for support, or keep her troubles to herself and suffer in silence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Meredith Marks Has A Massive Net Worth Thanks To Her Designer Jewelry Business</h2><p>Despite her troubled marriage, Marks is not one to back out from an affluent lifestyle as her career yields her handsome profits year after year. Even her fellow castmates Jen and Lisa can't keep themselves from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shopping</a> off of the talented designer. When we say "shopping off of," it literally means shopping off as the other two housewives are known to have even bought the rings off her fingers.</p><p>Not just her fellow housewives, Marks' designs are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrity favorites</a> and can be seen donned by the likes of&nbsp;Rhianna, Charlize Theron, Courteney Cox, and many others. Plus, being on one of the hottest franchises on TV doesn't hurt her bottom line either. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to reports from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cheat Sheet</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yahoo! Finance</a>, the housewives that star on the show make a median average of around a million dollars per season plus bonuses. In addition to that, the Yahoo! site also claims that the fan-favorites&nbsp;are paid dearly just to stay put for future seasons.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Long story short, the affluent jewelry designer has a massive net worth to back her outgoing lifestyle. In contradiction, her love life at home and drama with the fellow castmembers would probably be what keeps the viewers glued to their seats this season.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6bCprHNZqSeqpWZtrW0jKaYq6OjYrumwIywpqusmGKzornIpbBnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

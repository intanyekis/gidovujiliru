Do a mashup.</p><p>The look goes by many names.&nbsp;Fashion&nbsp;writer Dawnn Karen referenced the feel-good brain chemical in her book “Dress Your Best Life,” holding that “dopamine dressing” — wearing clothes in your own, individual style — gives you positive feelings.</p><p>Decorators and influencers say the same thing happens when we throw out old decor rules and step into a space adorned with personal touches. We’re more relaxed. More creative.</p><p>People are asking themselves what colors and patterns they really love, “and then bringing those features into their spaces — even if it goes against conventional decorating advice or what they might have seen online 10 years ago,” says Lauren Phillips, associate director of special projects at Better Homes & Gardens.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The trend toward making rooms more comfortable, functional&nbsp;and personal&nbsp;gained steam&nbsp;during the pandemic. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘BARKITECTURE’ AND OTHER WAYS TO USE A ROOM</h2><p>The trend toward making rooms more comfortable, functional&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and personal</a>&nbsp;gained steam&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">during the pandemic,</a>&nbsp;when many people were homebound. And it continues to grow, Phillips says.</p><p>“Unused guest rooms are home offices. Formal dining rooms become craft spaces. And ‘barkitecture’ is having a moment — installing dog baths and other pet-specific features,” she says.</p><p>Decor is awash in aesthetic “cores” —&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbiecore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cottagecore</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">coastal grandma</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mermaidcore</a>.</p><p>“But I don’t take it to mean we’re bouncing from trend to trend super quickly. To me, it means people are defining their own style, and really getting to the root of the designs they love, even if that’s a little more colorful, kitschy or funky,” says Phillips.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gen Z is on the cusp of homeownership and is more likely to mix styles, says a New York-based interiors expert. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SOCIAL MEDIA HAS LOOSENED THE CREATIVE REINS</h2><p>There’s lots of inspiration on the internet. “If, 15 years ago, we all wanted the picture-perfect kitchen we saw online, today it’s all about taking a trend or beautiful interior that you see on TikTok or Instagram and pulling out the details you love,” says Phillips.</p><p>“Gen Z is on the cusp of becoming our new homeowner,” says Amanda Kruse of Upspring PR, a New York-based marketing firm for real estate, design and interiors.</p><p>And they’re more likely to mix styles for a personal spin, she says.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">“It’s all about taking a trend or beautiful interior that you see on TikTok or Instagram and pulling out the details you love,” another expert says. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>ARTSY ELEMENTS</h2><p>Emilie Munroe began designing a San Francisco family’s Victorian home by leafing through a sheaf of torn-out magazine images from the client.</p><p>“We knew immediately our design should exude happiness and inspire curiosity,” says Munroe.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">It “used to be wacky to paint a room pink from top to bottom,” says a design editor, but now, “I’m here for it!” <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>A tiny powder room got an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exuberant pink-and-black,</a>&nbsp;animal-print wallpaper. In a tight hallway next to a window, there’s a kaleidoscopic wallpaper, an abstract rug and a Basquiat-patterned chair.</p><p>London-based design editor Cara Gibbs, meanwhile, has noticed the free-wheeling use of paint.</p><p>“I feel like it used to be wacky to paint a room pink from top to bottom, but now the application of these bright, poppy palettes is chic, interesting and most importantly very livable.

But nudge the secret panel in the living room bookcase and you’ll find a cozy, color-saturated, album-lined music den.

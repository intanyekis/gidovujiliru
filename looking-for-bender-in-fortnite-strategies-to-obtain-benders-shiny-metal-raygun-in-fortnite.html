This formidable weapon was introduced in Chapter 4: Season 3, inviting players to uncover and wield its power in their gameplay.</p><p>As a Mythic weapon, the Shiny Metal Raygun holds a place among the rarest and most potent items within Fortnite. Mythic items are revered for their exceptional abilities, often providing unique features and substantial advantages over lower-rarity alternatives. Due to their scarcity, Mythic weapons are highly coveted by players seeking an edge in competitive matches.</p><p>Belonging to the Submachine Gun category, the Shiny Metal Raygun excels in close to mid-range combat situations. Its rapid-fire nature enables players to unleash a flurry of bullets on opponents, proving particularly effective in fast-paced scenarios and close confrontations.</p><p>The arrival of the Shiny Metal Raygun in Chapter 4: Season 3 injected fresh excitement and variety into the Fortnite landscape. Those who obtained this rare weapon gained a strategic upper hand, especially in close-quarters combat where a robust and versatile option was crucial.</p><h2><span>Locating Bender in Fortnite</span></h2><p>Bender can be found in the southern part of Mega City, near the docks and close to the launch pad. By heading towards the docks and proceeding south in Mega City, players can easily spot Bender in proximity to the launch pad.</p><p>Currently in Fortnite’s Battle Royale mode, players have the opportunity to acquire Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun through a collaboration with the Futurama TV show. This weapon will be accessible until the v25.30 update rolls out. Typically, Fortnite updates release on Tuesdays, with the last update, v25.20, launched on July 26. Accordingly, players can expect the raygun to be available for around two weeks, until August 8.</p><p>To secure Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun, players have two avenues. The first involves finding it as floor loot during matches. However, given its Mythic rarity and the extensive array of weapons in Fortnite, stumbling upon it as loot might pose a challenge.</p><p>The second method is more straightforward – players can purchase the raygun directly from Bender in-game for 600 gold bars.</p><h2><span>Strategy to Attain Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun in Fortnite</span></h2><p>Securing Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun in Fortnite can be approached through two distinct paths: players may chance upon it as floor loot while playing or opt to buy it from the character Bender within the game. The Mythic rarity of this weapon underscores its exceptional power and uniqueness.</p><p>Delving further into the significance of its Mythic rarity, Fortnite categorizes weapons into different tiers, ranging from Common (gray) to Mythic (gold). Mythic weapons, being incredibly rare, confer exceptional capabilities, often tilting battles in players’ favor. Their scarcity compared to lower-rarity items in the game sets them apart.</p><p>The challenge for players lies in Fortnite’s expansive weapon selection. With numerous firearm types, explosives, and melee weapons available, the likelihood of encountering a specific Mythic weapon like Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun as loot is meager. This probability diminishes further due to the randomized loot spawns.</p><p>To balance the acquisition of Mythic weapons, Epic Games incorporates NPCs like Bender at designated map locations. These NPCs vend Mythic weapons in exchange for in-game currency, with Bender offering the Shiny Metal Raygun for 600 gold bars. This assures players a reliable method to obtain the coveted Mythic weapon without relying solely on fortuitous loot finds.</p><h2>Securing Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun <span>in Fortnite</span></h2><p>In Fortnite Battle Royale, Bender’s Shiny Metal Raygun emerges as a prized mythic weapon. Players can procure it by finding it as loot during matches or by purchasing it from the NPC character Bender, who roams the southern part of Mega City POI on the game’s Island. Solely available in mythic rarity, this weapon holds significant rarity and power.</p><p>Distinct in its firing mechanism, the Shiny Metal Raygun unleashes infinite plasma rays, granting a continuous stream of firepower without the need for reloading. Yet, its power is tempered by a cooldown mechanism that activates after extended use, momentarily overheating the weapon.</p><p>Functionally akin to the Kymera Ray Gun introduced in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7, both weapons deal 15 damage points per hit. The raygun’s proficiency in mid to long-range battle, owing to its rapid-fire and accuracy, presents an appealing choice for players preferring engagements from a distance.</p><p>Regarding effectiveness against player-built structures (“builds”), players debate the raygun’s efficacy in swiftly destroying enemy constructions during frenzied build encounters, potentially proving disadvantageous in certain scenarios.</p><p>However, the Shiny Metal Raygun shines in a “Zero Build” setting, where players are refrained from erecting defensive structures. Here, the weapon’s lethal firepower becomes a significant asset, enabling players to inflict substantial damage with no hindrance from enemy builds.</p><p>TRENDING</p><p><i>Disclaimer</i>: The above information is intended for general informational purposes only.

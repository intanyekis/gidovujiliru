A source exclusively told Us at the time that Jenner was “enjoying getting to know” the actor and was “open to seeing where things go.”</p><p>Two months later, the Kylie Cosmetics founder was photographed with Chalamet for the first time during a day date in Los Angeles. Despite the relationship still being in its infancy, an insider told Us in June that the Wonka actor had already <a href=#>met some of Jenner’s family</a>.</p><p>“They really like him and think he’s different from anybody Kylie has dated in the past,” the insider said of Jenner’s relative’s reaction to her new romance. “He has a great sense of humor, and he makes her smile which is the most important thing to them. They love seeing how happy she is and absolutely approve of them dating.”</p><p>Things between the pair heated up even more in September when Jenner was spotted packing on the PDA with Chalamet at <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong>‘s birthday concert</a> in L.A. That same month, the duo were seen at <a href=#>the U.S. Open</a> and Paris Fashion Week.</p><p>In the months that followed, Jenner and Chalamet’s relationship has “<a href=#>become fairly serious</a>,” an insider exclusively told Us in December.</p><p>While they haven’t publicly commented on their romance, Jenner quietly attended the L.A. premiere of Chalamet’s Wonka on December 10. “She’s one of his biggest supporters and was so glad she and <strong>Kris [Jenner]</strong> were able to be there,” the source told Us of the outing.</p><p>Fans think Chalamet returned the favor and supported Kylie and her family by seemingly attending <a href=#>their annual Christmas Eve party</a> on Sunday, December 24. A person resembling the Lady Bird actor could be seen in the background of <strong>Landon Barker</strong>’s Snapchat video from the celebration.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the clip, Landon, 20, filmed his dad, <strong>Travis Barker</strong>, making a duckface for the camera. Over Travis’ left shoulder, two individuals, who appeared to be Chalamet and Kylie were chatting and smiling.</p><p>“Look who was at the annual Kardashian Christmas party … LOL,” one X user wrote after the clip went viral on social media. A second user wrote, “Hottest PR I’ve ever seen no lie.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm62xKelnqpdna60ecBmqqmdk56urXnCqKWnnZOptrC6jLCgraBdqbauu9OhnJ5lk52ura3Mnqto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

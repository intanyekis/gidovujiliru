But as it later became apparent, appearances can be deceiving.</p><p>Beneath the veneer of perfection, <a href=#>Todd and Julie were involved in some pretty shady financial dealings</a>, which ultimately led to them getting indicted, tried, and later incarcerated for fraud early this year.</p><p>But the reprisals didn’t end there. Aside from<a href=#> a combined 19-year prison sentence</a>, the twosome was also ordered to pay a jaw-dropping $17.2 million in restitution fees. With Todd and Julie’s combined net worth nowhere near $17.2 million, the Chrisleys now find themselves at a financial crossroads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The family’s sole beacon of hope appears to be 25-year-old Savannah Chrisley, who, aside from <a href=#>taking charge of her younger siblings while her parents serve their sentences</a>, has pledged to wipe out the debt. However, with all the reality shows featuring the Chrisley clan now canceled, Savannah’s most prominent source of income appears to be podcasting. So, does the Chrisley Knows Best alum make enough from her Unlocked podcast to cough up $17.2 million?</p><h2 id=savannah-chrisley-intends-to-pay-todd-and-julie-chrisley-rsquo-s-17-million-restitution-fees>Savannah Chrisley Intends To Pay Todd And Julie Chrisley’s $17 Million Restitution Fees</h2><p>Chrisley knows best stars Todd and Julie have been having a tough go of it for quite some time. The twosome’s picture-perfect life first hit a snag in 2019, when they were indicted on a dozen counts of fraud by a federal grand jury.</p><p>Following a riveting three-week trial that kicked off in March 2022, the two were convicted, sentenced to a combined 19 years in federal prison, and ordered to pay $17 million in restitution fees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/savannah-1-1.jpg><p>Per the New York Post, the substantial bill left the once wealthy Chrisleys in a rather precarious position, as their combined fortunes were nowhere near sufficient to cover it. “They're going to have to give up a lot of things, including their homes, sadly," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source revealed to the outlet</a>.</p><p>"They won't be able to afford it. But their main concern now is their children, especially their youngest boy."</p><p>However, it appears the twosome might not have to languish under the crushing debt for long. Speaking to ET earlier this month, the duo's newly-appointed counsel, Jay Surgent, confirmed that their daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Savannah, intends to clear it on their behalf</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything The Chrisley Children Have Said About Their Parents' Trial And Sentencing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think Savannah, while it's not her job to make restitution on behalf of her parents, she has every intention. I've spoken to her a number of times about it. She has every intention to do everything she can do to make restitution on behalf of her parents from the outside," he said, adding, “Savannah happens to be in a situation that she's very creative, she has a unique talent and she's a great interviewer.

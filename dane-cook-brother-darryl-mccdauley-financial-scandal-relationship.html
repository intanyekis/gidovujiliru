He is of Irish descent and was brought up in a Catholic household. Dane grew up with 5 sisters and his older half-brother Darryl McCauley.</p><p>As a young adult, Dane described himself as quite shy and introverted. As of now, that doesn’t seem to be the case. In fact, he’s quite the opposite. When Dane first discovered that he could make people laugh, before he turned it into a career, he said that he got his sense of humor from his parents, mother, Donna Jean, and father, John F. Cook who are now deceased.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dane-cook-deposit-photos.png><p>Growing up in a household full of girls, Dane formed a close relationship with his brother, Darryl since they were the only boys in the house.</p><p>During an interview with YMH Clips Dane even stated how he loved his brother a lot and that Darryl was his first best friend in his life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="A Deeper Look At The Ups And Downs In Comedian Dane Cook's Private Life">A Deeper Look At The Ups And Downs In Comedian Dane Cook's Private Life</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Dane was just starting to make it big in Hollywood, he didn’t leave his family behind. Dane built a house for his parent and hired his brother Darryl as his business manager. Before Dane hired his brother to work for him, Darryl used to work as a correction officer for a little over a decade. Since Darryl McCauley is 7 years older than his brother, Dane found it wise to hire him to deal with his finances because, for one, he was his brother, and Dane trusted him. What could go wrong with that combination?</p><p>Darryl started working for his brother in the early 1990s. When Darryl first started working for Dane, he was genuine and did his work so well. The pay per year for Darryl was $150,000. That is a lot of money. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Until greed took over Darryl</a> because he thought he can make a lot more money from his brother illegally and get away with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-dane-cook-rsquo-s-brother-darryl-mccauley-betray-him>How Did Dane Cook’s Brother Darryl McCauley Betray Him?</h2><p>Darryl McCauley was found <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stealing millions of dollars from his brother, Dane</a>. While Dane sat down for an interview with YMH Clips, he explained to them the day he discovered his brother was siphoning money from him. “I woke up one morning, I was buying a house in California and because I was buying a house here, my business was still run out of a P.O. Box in Massachusetts.”</p><p>Dane said and continued, “So I ended up talking to my brother and saying that I found a new business manager out here. You’re going to have a different position in the Company. You can do fulfillment center stuff or merger and I’m just gonna do myself out here because I’m buying a home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dane-cook-deposit-photos-png-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That decision didn’t sit well with Darryl. That’s when Dane realized something was not right. It turns out, Darryl had been sending Dane fake statements for over a decade.</p><p>Thereafter, Dane woke up on a Monday morning, turned to his girlfriend, and something just clicked in his head, with a sure assurance that his brother stole his money. It turns out he was right. This situation caused<a href=#> Dane to sue his brother</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Everything We Know About Dane Cook's Girlfriend, Kelsi Taylor">Everything We Know About Dane Cook's Girlfriend, Kelsi Taylor</a></span></p><p>According to The Boston Globe, from 2004 to 2008, Darryl was transferring money from Dane's business and personal account to his account.</p><p>On October 2010, Darryl plead guilty and received a sentence of 5 to 6 years in prison. He was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ordered to pay Dane $12 million</a>.

That doesn’t give them the right to take advantage of your kindness for weakness. In Dane Cook’s case, his brother Darryl broke his trust in the most painful way a brother ever could. Dane trusted Dayrll with his million, and what did he get in return, a kick in the back?</p><p>Perhaps behind closed doors, Dane has been able to forgive his brother for the uttermost betrayal, but one thing is for sure, he will never forget, and that same level of trust he had for his brother will never be rebuilt again.</p><p>Their <a href=#>relationship may never get any better</a>. As far as the public knows, Dane is not on speaking terms with his brother and his wife who helped him carry out the embezzlement because she knew about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Dane Cook's Team Was Not Happy When He Decided To Skip His SNL Audition">Dane Cook's Team Was Not Happy When He Decided To Skip His SNL Audition</a></span></p><p>Clearly, when Darryl was carrying out the thievery, he didn’t think it through. He forgot about the saying that goes the days of a thief are forty.

Guzman said while they met through acquaintances and their relationship remained platonic, since the birth of their daughter it’s been quite a rocky road.</p><p>“Not until the custody issues were raised, that’s when we stopped talking and negativity started. But in the beginning of all this, it was all love. We both went through breakups, we both dealt with them, we both checked on each other throughout everything going on,” Guzman said to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Latina Magazine</a> “And then to be here now is just really… is just really crazy, and it’s really hurtful. I don’t know how to get back to the way we were, until time can heal that.”</p><p>Guzman promises the latest courtroom squabble between her and Brown wasn’t about limiting his visitation rights with Royalty, but instead hopefully agreeing upon a nanny that can assist Brown when Royalty comes by.</p><p>“He knows he cannot do it on his own. She’s only two, and she’s a lot of work. I just wanted a nanny in place when she was with him, and it be agreed upon. It’s not like I was just going to throw anybody in there, it was something that we would agree, and this was what it was going to be, and then we go forth.”</p><p>Guzman also dished on her side of the story regarding Royalty’s ballet outfit, to which Brown took to social media to blast Guzman for dressing her in what he believed was inappropriate attire.</p><p>“I have a phone. I have a phone, and I tried over and over and over to co-parent, to try and get this right. It went global! The picture’s everywhere! I personally saw nothing wrong with it. She always dresses like that to dance class. It was a cute picture, she had just finished dance, she was pouting. It was a funny moment,” Guzman said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2onnGrrGmmZ5iv7DFwKWrsmWSp7y4uoyipa2doqu2psOMbWltaGlqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

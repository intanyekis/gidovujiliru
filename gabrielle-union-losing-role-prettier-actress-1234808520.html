The 51-year-old reflected on a moment when she was passed on for a role due to her appearance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Years ago, I was up for a big job,” detailed the actress to Netflix’s Strong Black Lead platform Sunday. “And after numerous callbacks, and studio tests, it was down to just the two of us.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was told I didn’t get the part because ‘She’s just prettier than you.’ For someone who had low self-esteem, it just felt like there was no place for me, for my kind of Blackness.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1499233459.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In her reflection, the<a href=#> Perfect Find</a> star explains how the moment impacted her outlook on the entertainment industry.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It pretty much killed that confident pep in my step, and I was equating my looks to my ability to do the job,” expressed Union. “I recognize that if I had gotten that job and I was around people like that, my soul would be worn down.

He was the one a lot of times that would tell me to pull back. ‘I understand you want to give it your all, I understand that you’re a perfectionist, but you’re overthinking it. Just let it be and you need to rest.’</p><p>“I need that because I put enough pressure on myself, I push myself enough. My husband is my ying to my yang, he balances me out. But on the road, he drove every single live event, even the four-hour, five-hour drives til three o’clock in the morning. He never let me drive. He let me get as much rest as I needed.”</p><h2 id=h-double-duty-for-both>Double duty for both</h2><p>Belair added, “But at the same time, it’s hard to navigate because my husband, he’s a WWE superstar too. So while he’s trying to support me, he has to worry about his career. And while I’m so worried about my career, I can’t forget to support my husband. So it was just like double duty for both of us. We were both just equally exhausted.”</p><p>Belair and Ford will be featured on a new reality series titled <a href=#>Love & WWE: Bianca & Montez</a>. The series will begin streaming on Hulu in February.</p><p><a href=#>Bianca Belair Looks Back On RAW Women’s Title Reign, Feeling Sick At WrestleMania 39</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsam1vZmKvqq3NnJhmmpWhrqq%2BjKKqZp6fp8G2usCtnGasn2LEsL7KZq6irJhiurC6056xZp6fp7FutMRmmZqkkaOwpr%2BMppxmp6Wp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

However, when it comes to his love life, DMX has a solid track record.</p><p>He is the father of 15 kids by nine different women. In 1999, he married Tashera Simmons, a girl he had known since infancy. Sean, Xavier, Tacoma, and Praise Mary Ella are their four children. His erratic behavior, which included three arrests and cheating on her with other women, caused their breakup.</p><p>He is the parent of a child born to Patricia Trejo.

Exodus Simmons, who was then engaged to DMX, was Desiree.</p><p>DMX fought for his children’s child support in court for a long time since he was supposed to pay a lot of it but kept forgetting.

After all, we repeat them. Shouldn't we know where they came from? To not would be foolish. And, as we all know, a fool and his bacon are soon parted...</p><h2 id=bacon>Bacon</h2><p>Bringing home the bacon is a phrase most people know. Where did it come from? According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phrases.org</a>,&nbsp;it is often&nbsp;linked to be the story of the Dunmow Flitch. A local couple in 1104, were found to be so impressive with their marital devotion to one another that they were awarded a flitch (a.k.a. a side) of bacon.</p><h2 id=bread>Bread</h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>12 Reasons Why Female Celebs Choose Off The Rack Fashion (12 Why They Spend The Extra Dough)</a></span></p><p>This one comes from&nbsp;the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">English Cockney Rhyming Slang</a> term, “Bread and Honey” , which means "money". This is also where "dough" comes from. Dough makes bread. If you're just realizing that, you're not alone. Mind. Blown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bucks>Bucks</h2><p>Big bucks. No Whammy. Stop. Stop at a somewhat disputed origin that goes back to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">deer in the 1700s</a>. The idea that trading deerskin was seen as a form of currency. Therefore, if you had bucks, you had buck.</p><h2 id=cheddar>Cheddar</h2><p>One would think that cheddar is delicious and money is too. While true, it isn't the reason we give our cash such a cheesy nickname. Cheddar comes from the food purchases that those on food stamp programs are typically associated with buying. Think of it as an off-shoot of "Government Cheese" slang.</p><h2 id=clams>Clams</h2><p>This one is pretty basic. Native Americans used clams as money. That's it. Fred Flintstone did too, but he's a cartoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fiver>Fiver</h2><p>This one is for a five dollar note. There's no mystery here as it just takes the word it is referring to and messes with it. By the same token, "tenner" is used for ten and "hundo" is used for a hundred.</p><h2 id=grand>Grand</h2><p>Believe it or not, this one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">means what it sounds like</a>. At the turn of the 20th century,&nbsp;one <a href=#>thousand dollars</a> was considered to be a "grand" amount of money. People used it and it caught on in grand fashion.</p><h2 id=green-greenbacks-lettuce>Green, Greenbacks, Lettuce</h2><p>These all deal with the color of money (the color, not the movie). In the United States, paper money is green and, with that, came a reference to anything green</p><h2 id=loot>Loot</h2><p>This one comes from the Hindi language during the the Hindustani colonial years. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Lut" means spoils pillaged from the enemy during war</a>. "Loot" is what you drop<a href=#> on your bling.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=moolah>Moolah</h2><p>Not just the legendary female wrestler. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moolah</a>" is also the Fijian word for money. It is the most likely reason we use it for slang when referring to our own nuggets.</p><h2 id=nuggets>Nuggets</h2><p>The gold rush was all about the moolah and the gold nuggets that netted the most were the nuggets that mattered most.</p><h2 id=quid>Quid</h2><p>This British slang for a one pound sterling coin is though to come from the term "quid pro quo" which,&nbsp; is a Latin phrase meaning an exchange of goods or services, where &nbsp;transfer is contingent upon a returned favor. The phrase directly means "a favor for a favor".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scratch>Scratch</h2><p>This one is a...(hate to do it)...<a href=#>head-scratcher.</a> While the term showed up in the 20th century, few can find its meaning. Often, it's said that “Scratch” or “Old Scratch” as a term for the Devil, derived from the Old Norse word “skratte” which means “goblin.”</p><h2 id=smackers>Smackers</h2><p>$100 is one hundred smackers. It's origin is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">often traced to 1918</a> and the sound money made when "smacked" into one's hand. In fact, the original term credited to money was "smackeroo", but it evolved to smacker in 1939.</p><h2 id=simoleans>Simoleans</h2><p>This one is old school. There is the late 1800s&nbsp;blending of simon, meaning "dollar", with simon, the term for a sixpence coin. Although it is also linked to Napoleon and his appearance on the French coin worth 20 francs, featuring the image of Napoleon III.</p><h2 id=two-bits>Two-bits</h2><p>Hey bub, you got my two bits there? You're the bee's knees. In the case of the twenty-five cent piece,&nbsp;“bit” was an English term for any coin of a low denomination. In the early days of the United States, some Mexican and Spanish coins were worth one-eighth of a single peso. So, at twelve and a half cents, two bits equaled a quarter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Rap Dictionary: 10 Hip-Hop Slang Words For Money</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Word Detective</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phrases.org</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thrillest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Times of India</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Etymoney</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yopZ6xXai5orrGZqueqp2oerC%2ByKCgp6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

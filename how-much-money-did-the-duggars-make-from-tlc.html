During their early days on TLC, viewers were intrigued and a bit miffed by the family's daily lives and their beliefs. Over time, viewers grew concerned about the sheltered lives the Duggar kids appeared to lead, especially when the older kids began courting and getting married.Then came Josh Duggar's scandal and subsequent prison sentence; the family <a href=#>may have even lost friends</a> over that scandal and its reach. TLC canceled the family's show, subsequently launching and later canceling a spinoff as well. Yes, a lot has changed for the Duggars, as reality TV opportunities have come and gone. But through it all, the Duggars do have one thing: their money. Just how much, though, did they earn from TLC before they were canceled for good, and did Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar share the wealth?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-michelle-and-jim-bob-s-net-worth>What Is Michelle And Jim Bob's Net Worth?</h2><p>Though reality TV was no doubt a boon for the Duggars' net worth, they also have other income streams â€” or at least, they did when 19 Kids was filming. Long-time viewers might recall that Jim Bob often took the kids with him to their rental properties, whether to clean up after tenants who moved out or to renovate newly purchased properties for habitation.</p><p>The Duggars were also illustrated as being very frugal on their show. Michelle would discuss cheap meals for her growing family, talk about thrift store shopping, and note that hand-me-downs were part of life (why wouldn't they be, with that many kids!).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Have Any Of The Duggars Gone To College?">Have Any Of The Duggars Gone To College?</a></span></p><p>When they built their current home, both Duggar parents talked about how they had cut costs by essentially DIYing the build from a pre-purchased kit. Sure, the Arkansas home is giant, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with over 97 acres of land</a>, and also offers living spaces for multiple Duggar kids' families. But it wasn't built too expensively, for the amenities it offers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of their current net worth, that house might be part of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">total $3.5M net worth</a> that Distractify reports.</p><p>Yet the net worth also spans multiple rental properties, as well as properties the Duggars have flipped and sold.</p><p>While most of their income used to come from reality TV, the Duggars did make a sweet mansion in Arkansas and got all their cash back.

But it seems that might not be the case.

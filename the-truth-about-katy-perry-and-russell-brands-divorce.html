It all happened so fast that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we tend to forget it even happened</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The one thing we'll never be able to forget about their breakup, though, is the fact that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand ended their marriage by text</a>, like something out of one of Perry's songs. Lucky for Perry, though, Brand decided not to rob her of everything she was worth,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taking nothing in their divorce settlement</a>. He just left her a heartbroken divorcee by the age of 28.</p><p>Now the pair have successfully moved on from their marital mistake. Brand is married with kids, and Perry just had a baby with Orlando Bloom. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where do they stand today</a>?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-whirlwind-romance>Their Whirlwind Romance</h2><p>It was love at first sight for Perry and Brand when they met at the 2008 VMAs. Sparks clearly flew after they made out during Perry's cameo in&nbsp;Get Him to the Greek. They flirted at 2009 VMAs after Perry threw a water bottle at him to get his attention at rehearsals. Brand told Jay Leno that it "was like being struck by cupid but sort of in a riot."</p><p>Four months later, they got engaged on New Year's Eve in India and got matching tattoos of the Sanskirt phrase "Anuugacchati Pravaha," which means go with the flow.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Guys Katy Perry Dated & 5 Girls Orlando Bloom Dated (Before They Got Together)</a></span></p><p>There might have been trouble in paradise before they tied the knot. David Baddiel, a close friend of Brand's and a wedding guest, said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell told him that he and Perry had a huge fight</a> the night before getting married. "I did think when he said that, of asking, ‘Are you sure?’ but I didn’t say that. Perhaps I should have done," Baddiel said. They proceeded with the marriage, having an extravagant Hindu ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brand told Ellen Degeneres, "Yeah. I am really happily married. I'm married to Katy. Perpetually until death do us part was the pledge," while Perry told DeGeneres, "I would love to have children. I think that’s one of the reasons you get married, and especially to the person that you marry." Having kids turned out to be one of the possible causes of their breakup, however.</p><p>By December 30, Brand filed for divorce, citing&nbsp;"irreconcilable differences."</p><h2 id=they-never-revealed-what-caused-them-to-split-sort-of>They Never Revealed What Caused Them To Split...Sort Of</h2><p>Following a text from Brand letting her know they were divorcing, Perry was distraught. By 2012,&nbsp;she still hadn't heard from him since that last explosive text. Meanwhile, Brand said in a statement, "Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her, and I know we'll remain friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Many Celebrity Guys Has Katy Perry Dated?</a></span></p><p>Perry was not pleased with the gossip surrounding the divorce. She tweeted,&nbsp;"I am so grateful for all the love and support I've had from people around the world. You guys have made my heart happy again. Concerning the gossip, I want to be clear that NO ONE speaks for me. Not a blog, magazine, 'close sources' or my family."&nbsp;Perry's&nbsp;evangelical pastor parents called her divorce "a gift from God" during a service.</p><p>Perry maintained&nbsp;that "Nobody knows what really happened except the two people who are in it," but&nbsp;she's revealed some theories about the break up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry documented the aftermath of the divorce in her documentary, Katy Perry: Part of Me.&nbsp;Ultimately, she had to tell herself&nbsp;none of it was&nbsp;her fault.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Russell Brand Thinks About Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Expecting A Child</a></span></p><p>"I have to claim my own responsibility in things. I do admit that I was on the road a lot. Although I invited him time and time again, and I tried to come home as much as I possibly could. You saw that in the movie," she told Vogue.</p><p>Both Perry and Brand have inferred that they didn't work because of their different lifestyles, although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry thinks Brand wanted to be the one in control</a>, especially when it came to having kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At first when I met him, he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal, and they’re like, I can’t handle the equalness," she said. "He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting. I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go, and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that."</p><p>Brand&nbsp;told Howard Stern they did try to work it out because they were in love "but it was difficult to see each other; it mostly didn't work for practical reasons." The media coverage&nbsp;didn't help either.</p><p>In his documentary, Brand: A Second Coming, he said, "I’m living this life of the very thing I detest. Vapid, vacuous celebrity. Fame and power is b*****."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, he said, "Katy was obviously very, very occupied and busy. I was occupied and busy but not to the same degree. The marriage didn't last for a very long time, and I think that is due to the undulating nature of fame, living in those conditions. I have come away from that experience, and I still feel very warm towards her."</p><h2 id=did-brand-ever-apologize>Did Brand Ever Apologize?</h2><p>After a few years, the dust settled between them. A source told The Sun that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell wanted to apologize to Perry</a>&nbsp;"for his moods and jealousy" and "for the way it ended, which was mostly his doing."</p><p>During a live&nbsp;Q&A with fans on TikTok, Brand said, "I really tried in that relationship. I have nothing but positive feelings for her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We don't know whether or not he actually apologized for what happened between them, or at least for the way he ended things, but they've both moved on. We don't know if they ever became friends either.&nbsp;Brand removed his tattoo and Perry from his life in 2012.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry Once Dished Out $200,000 To Launch Russell Brand Into Space!</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rK3TsmSpnaKnxm6tzZ1kq62jqLKtuIybqZqmlKh6pbXVqKmcnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

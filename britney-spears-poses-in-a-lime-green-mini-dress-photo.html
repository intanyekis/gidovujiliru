In one clip, Spears rocked a fur shawl draped over her shoulders while shimmying. The strapless piece featured a <a href=#>sweetheart neckline, a beaded design</a> and a sparkly fringe. She teamed the outfit up with black open-toed pumps.</p><p>To elevate her getup even more, the “Oops! … I Did It Again” artist dazzled in two different jewelry looks — one featured a navy-blue pendant and the other had multiple silver chains draped over her collarbone. For glam, the Louisiana native wore her <a href=#>signature dark eyeliner</a> around her eyes. Her <a href=#>crimped tresses</a> were styled in a half-up look, with her bangs perfectly framing her face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Britney-Spears-Instagram-2.jpg><p>The “… Baby One More Time” singer walked up to the camera to give her fans a good look at the garb. She also grabbed the top of her ensemble and pulled it up while smiling to give the dress a better fit and then twirled around, flipping her long locks over her shoulders.</p><p>This is not the first time the “Circus” musician rocked a vibrant piece on social media this year. Last month, Spears sported a crimson mini dress featuring a bodycon fit and off-the-shoulder sleeves. In the <a href=#>TikTok video</a>, she gave the camera a sultry pout while putting a suede top hat on. The “Womanizer” artist’s hair was styled in beachy waves that were again half pinned up, and she added a bit of sparkle to the number with a diamond necklace.</p><p>“I was channeling Julia Roberts with this red hat !!!,” she captioned the post. Spears may have been referring to the red off-the-shoulder gown <strong>Roberts</strong>, 55, wore while filming <a href=#>Pretty Woman</a> in 1990.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fans were quick to show their support for the pop star in the comments section. One enthusiastically wrote, “QUEEN OF RED,” alongside a heart emoji. Another commented, “So happy to see you thriving the way you want to,” and a third said, “You look beautiful in red.”</p><p>Spears also looked stylish in a scarlet mini dress at the 2019 premiere of Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood. The Nookie ensemble featured a one-shoulder strap, chic cutout on her torso, and delicate sweetheart neckline. She also stunted a diamond choker and studs. For glam, the mother-of-two <a href=#>styled her hair</a> in a fabulous ponytail and donned smokey eyeshadow and rosy lips.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2FqsDNnrBmq6CarrO%2FjKmmrJ2jYravecBmo6KllWK0s7HEp2SmoZ6eeqW%2BxKyqZqiYpMGwew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

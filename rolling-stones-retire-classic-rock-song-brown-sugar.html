I’m trying to figure out with the sisters quite where the beef is. Didn’t they understand this was a song about the horrors of slavery? But they’re trying to bury it.”</p><p>The first verse of the hit song depicts slaves being sold and beaten in Louisiana, with references to a “slaver” who whips “women just around midnight.”</p><p>The famous chorus portrays a non-consensual sex encounter between the violent master and a young female slave, while possibly also alluding to heroin use.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/rolling-stones-brown-sugar-341.jpg><p>In the next verse, the song describes the abuse suffered by slaves on a plantation. Lead singer Mick Jagger ends the tune by singing, “How come you taste so good … just like a black girl should.”</p><p>“We’ve played ‘Brown Sugar’ every night since 1970,” Richards told the newspaper.</p><p>“So sometimes you think, ‘We’ll take that one out for now and see how it goes.’ We might put it back in.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/rolling-stones-brown-sugar-343.jpg><p>The Stones have played the song live 1,136 times, second to only “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to setlist.fm</a>.</p><p>“At the moment I don’t want to get into conflicts with all of this s–t,” Richard said of criticism of the song. “But I’m hoping that we’ll be able to resurrect the babe in her glory somewhere along the track.”</p><p>The Stones were five shows into their “<a href=#>No Filter</a>” tour Wednesday. The concerts marked the septuagenarians’ first gigs since 2019, and the first performances without drummer <a href=#>Charlie Watts</a>, who died in August at the age of 80.</p><p>Jagger is clearly not singing the song in the first person, but the danceable tune has been slammed in recent years, with some critics dubbing it “<a href=#>stunningly crude and offensive</a>.”</p><p>Other commentators have conceded it is “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gross, sexist, and stunningly offensive</a>,” but still rocking.</p><p>“I never would write that song now,” Jagger <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Rolling Stone</a> in 1995. “I would probably censor myself. I’d think, ‘Oh God, I can’t. I’ve got to stop. I can’t just write raw like that.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brown Sugar</a> by Jagger/Richards</p><p>Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields<br>Sold in the market down in New Orleans<br>Scarred old slaver knows he’s doing alright<br>Hear him whip the women just around midnight</p><p>Brown sugar,&nbsp;how come you taste so good?

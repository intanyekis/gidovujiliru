Upon matriculation, he enrolled at the University of Utah and played for the college team – the Utah Utes, distinguishing himself as a player.</p><p>In no time, Scott’s professional playing career began, when he was selected in the 1990 NFL Draft as the 93rd overall pick in the fourth round by the Miami Dolphins, so he signed a rookie contract, which marked the beginning of his net worth. He served as Dan Marino’s back-up for the next three years, until Dan was injured, so Scott was moved to the position of starting quarterback in 1993.</p><p>However, in the following season Scott became a part of the Detroit Lions, signing a contract with the team as a free agent, which added a considerable amount to his net worth.

Nevertheless, during the 1995-1996 season, he played again and set records not only for passing yards (4,338), but also for touchdown passes (32). Since then, he has not had any major success, except that he appeared in the NFL playoffs in 1995 and 1997.</p><p>In 1999, Scott became a member of the Baltimore Ravens, after which he played for the Cincinnati Bengals from 2000 until 2001. He finished his professional playing career with 15,692 passing yards.</p><p>Apart from his career in the NFL, Scott also played football in the World League of American Football for the Orlando Thunder in 1992, increasing further his net worth.</p><p>After retirement, Scott decided to stay in the sports industry as a football coach. In 2008, he was named the head coach of his alma mater Springville High School team. Four years later, he quit the job as he moved his focus to the business industry.</p><p>When it comes to speak about Scott Mitchell’s personal life, there in no information about it, except that he is married to Wendy.

It was really fun.”</p><p>A year of magical musings ensued, with Bartlett and the visionary director Scott Derrickson cooking up a cinematic cauldron brimming with potential. Bartlett, apparently still in disbelief about landing the gig, exclaimed, “I don’t know how I got that job. I did get the job.”</p><p>The tale of scriptwriting sorcery had two distinct chapters. First up, the <a href=# data-type=post_tag data-id=1828>Scott Derrickson</a> era, where Bartlett teamed up with the maestro himself. “We developed it for about a year in the room with Kevin [Feige] and Eric [Hauserman Carroll] and Lou [D’Esposito] and Richie [Palmer],” she said.</p><p>Alas, just when things were bubbling up, the pandemic played the villain, casting a shadow over the scriptwriting sanctum.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#DoctorStrange</a> Music Battle in Multiverse of Madness 🎼 <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/qYDapxynix</a></p>— Doctor Strange Updates (@DrStrangeUpdate) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">January 3, 2024</a><p>As for the script itself, Bartlett remains tight-lipped, bound by the sacred screenwriter’s oath of secrecy. “I am not permitted to discuss the manuscript in any way. She apologized, saying, “I can’t tell you anything,” leaving Marvel fans eager to learn the mysterious specifics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Doctor-Strange-2-1024x576.jpg><p>Despite the cloak of mystery surrounding the script, Bartlett couldn’t help but gush about her time with the Marvel maestros. “Working with them, everybody there really loves their job. They’re so kind and they’re very generous. It was like getting to work with scholars, I guess, scholars of these comic books. So that was fun.”</p><p>But wait, the multiverse tale took an unexpected twist of its own. Scott Derrickson, the director who brought the first “Doctor Strange” to life, exited stage left due to creative differences in January 2020.</p><p>In a surprising reveal, Derrickson shared that his version of “Doctor Strange 2” would have been a “genuine horror film of sorts,” a deviation from the mystical origins of its predecessor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I've been looking for you… for a long time." <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#DoctorStrange</a></p><p>Yes, same!

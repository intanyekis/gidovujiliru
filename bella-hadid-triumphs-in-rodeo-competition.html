Congratulations my love, so proud of you my cow girl,” she captioned a post via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday, April 14, alongside a photo of her daughter holding up two gold belt buckles.

Both her sister, <b>Gigi Hadid</b>, and Yolanda, 60, have noticed the strong bond between them.</p><p>“She’s really happy with Adan, and they share so much in common,” the source said at the time. “Gigi and Yolanda think that Bella’s finally met her perfect match.”</p><p>Along with her newfound romance, the model is embracing a change of scenery in Texas by redirecting her attention toward new priorities, including her shared passion for equestrian activities with Banuelos.</p><p>“She loves being out of Hollywood and will take modeling jobs if it’s a right fit, but has taken a step back for now,” the source added. “It’s not her priority anymore.”</p><p>The couple initially connected in October 2023, when they were seen being affectionate&nbsp; in Fort Worth, Texas. Earlier this year, Bella <a href=#>made their relationship Instagram official</a> by posting a throwback photo of them kissing at her birthday party the previous year.</p><p>“October 2023. My 27th Birthday🎈,” she wrote via Instagram in February, sharing a carousel of snaps.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In early March, Bella attended the American Performance Horseman event by Teton Ridge at Texas’ Globe Life Field. <a href=#>Embracing the country spirit</a>, she sported a festive outfit featuring a brown halter top and leather pants paired with a brown cowboy hat. She was seen enthusiastically cheering on Banuelos during his ride.</p><p>Bella’s enthusiasm for the equestrian circuit began earlier this year.</p><p>“Never stop trying new things. I feel lucky enough to have the opportunity to keep learning in life ❤️,” she wrote via Instagram in January. “Thank you Tito, I will never stop loving on you like this!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZyhrm60wJ2gnWWkp7a2uc%2BhqmahnmK%2FsLDEqGScp52lsrW106Kmp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

James Carville</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Out of all the SNL characters Hader impersonated, the most popular one was a political commentator and TV correspondent <a href=# rel="follow noopener">James Carville</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Carville was a bald, bespectacled CNN strategist who often appeared on ‘Weekend Update’ to comment on anything from the Republican Party to gun control and offered the most absurd pearls of wisdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Hader’s voice was always spot-on, with a silly Southern accent that made his whole persona even more outlandish.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>2. Stefon</h2><p>Another beloved character that Hader took on was Stefon, the crazy ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Weekend Update’</a>&nbsp;correspondent.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Stefon gave the most bizarre suggestions to New Yorkers and tourists on things like the most unusual hotspots and bars to visit across the city and some things people could do during holidays and special occasions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The comedian co-wrote his Stefon sketches with his SNL co-star <a href=# rel=follow>John Mulaney</a>, who purposely introduced jokes into the sketch while Hader was live on air.</p><p>This always made Hader break character, which made the entire sketch funnier.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>3. Vincent Price</h2><p>One of the most recurring SNL characters that Hader portrayed was horror movie star Vincent Price.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Bill Hader as one of his popular SNL characters, Vincent Price. </strong>(Source: Bill Hader/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Hader’s Price was a straight man who invited many celebrity guests for holiday specials to cause trouble.</p><p>Unfortunately, the hapless host could never get along with his guests.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Hader ended&nbsp;up causing&nbsp;troubles, and this, combined with his distinct nasal voice and exaggerated Hollywood celebrity mannerisms, made for a truly memorable portrayal.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. Vinny Vedecci</h2><p>Although Hader doing a thick Italian accent as Vinny Vedecci was often considered stereotypical, it is said to be one of his more beloved SNL characters.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Vedecci was a loud, unprofessional host of the Italian show&nbsp;La Rivista Della Televisione&nbsp;who flipped the script by making inaccurate and insulting comments about his guests.&nbsp;</p><p>Hader carried the sketch entirely on his back with his contagious energy and commitment to take it to a different level.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The personality he injected&nbsp;into the character and Hader’s fast mix of fluent and incoherent Italian gibberish earned two thumbs up from the viewers.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>5. Herb Welch</h2><p>Hader’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Herb Welch</a> is another of his iconic SNL characters on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Welch was an aging, grumpy, and often senile reporter whose overtly sexist, demeaning remarks contradict his devoutly religious views.&nbsp;</p><p>He preferred to be addressed as “Mr. Welch” and did not take suggestions or advice from anyone on how to do his job.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Welch would often be spotted at the scene of a major event, where he’ll interview a victim or witness but not before hitting them in their mouth with his large microphone.</p><p>Hader almost always made it look like he was about to break character, but he got it together and carried on, making it incredibly fun to watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqZoblutMCdnKtlo6O5bq%2FHmqmam6Sav7R6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

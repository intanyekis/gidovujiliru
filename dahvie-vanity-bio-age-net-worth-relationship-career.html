Dahvie Vanity demonstrates this even further. You might be wondering who Dahvie is.</strong></p><p>Dahvie Vanity is an American pop vocalist and the lead singer of the band Blood on the Floor. After the publication of the album Evolution in 2012, his band surged to notoriety. Among the group’s hit songs are Bewitched, I Refuse to Sink, Candyland, and Called Me Master.</p><p>Despite his celebrity and affluence, he does not neglect any gaps in supporting the underprivileged. Let’s find out more about him right now! Dahvie Vanity was born in the state of North Carolina in 1984. He is a Virgo by birth and celebrates his birthday on September 5th. He is an American national of white origin.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Dahvie_Vanity_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Dahvie Vanity? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Dahvie began his musical career by founding Love the Fashion with his buddies Rebecca Fugate and Christopher Mongillo. Following that, their band’s name was changed to Blood on the Dance Floor.</p><p>The band was committed to releasing their debut album, Let’s Start a Riot. The record, however, struggled to acquire momentum due to a lack of marketing. Dahvie Vanity is a singer and musician with a $1 million net worth.</p><p>This did not, however, discourage Blood on the Dance Floor. They scored a hit with their second album, “It’s Hard to Be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World.” When Mongillo and Fugate were unable to play in Orlando, the group disbanded during their travels.</p><p>Dahvie eventually befriended Garret Ecstasy and began working with him. Ecstasy’s successors, though, were Matty M and Jay Von Monroe. Matty eventually left the party as well. In contrast, the duo worked hard and created popular albums such as Epic (2009), All the Rage (2011), Evolution (2012), and the EP The Anthem of the Outcast (2012).</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Dahvie_Vanity_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Dahvie Vanity born?

His soulmate, Fallon Ven Detta, has always been there for him through thick and thin.</p><p>The pair have recently gotten engaged. On September 6, 2017, members of The Blood on the Dance Floor tweeted a selfie of themselves, revealing their engagement.</p><p>Dahvie grew up in a low-income home in North Carolina. His parents were close to him, although he had conflicting views about his musical achievements. Dahvie’s family, on the other hand, has been incredibly supportive throughout the entire process.

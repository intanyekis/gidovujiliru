Despite rumors suggesting that he is dealing with cancer, the former Virginia Tech basketball coach has not been diagnosed with the disease. However, his personal connection to cancer, stemming from his father’s battle with lung cancer, has fueled his commitment to cancer research. Seth Vincent Greenberg, originally from Plainview, New York, transitioned from a college basketball coach to an ESPN commentator.</p><p>Greenberg has an extensive history in college basketball, having played at Fairleigh Dickinson and then pursued a coaching career. He coached at various institutions before eventually becoming an ESPN college basketball commentator, working alongside prominent personalities such as Malika Andrews, Mike Greenberg, Richard Jefferson, and Doris Burke.</p><p>Addressing the speculations about his health, <strong>Seth Greenberg</strong> is currently in good health as there are no reports of any health concerns or illness as of 2024. He recently attended his youngest daughter’s wedding in late September 2023 and shared moments from the event on Instagram.</p><p>Contrary to misconceptions, Greenberg’s commitment to cancer research is deeply personal due to his father’s passing from lung cancer in 1996. His emotional connection to the cause is evident in his involvement in fundraising for The V Foundation and his remarks about the impact of cancer on individuals close to him.</p><p>Being one of three children born to <strong>Marilyn and Ralph Greenberg</strong>, <strong>Seth Greenberg</strong> and his wife, Karen Greenberg, have been married for over three decades and are parents to three daughters.</p><p><strong>Ella Greenberg Rash, Greenberg’s daughter</strong>, is married to Andrew Rash, and they have two children. Ella is active in the real estate and contracting field, while her husband works as a project manager. Seth’s other daughters, Paige Greenberg Armold and Jessica Greenberg Lyon, also have their own families and professional pursuits.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Seth-Greenberg-2.jpg alt="Seth Greenberg" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmisqZyRqbK0ec6nZKydpJ16qL7EnqWbnaKcwG60xJqjraBdnsButMRmmZqspKG2r7OMnJinm5WnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

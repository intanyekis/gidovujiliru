The actress spoke candidly about her relationship with her ex-boyfriend <strong><a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a></strong> for the first time and responded to the reports that she was the reason he allegedly has a strained relationship with his family.</p><p>“I have kind of avoided speaking about him for a long time,” Munn, 37, began in a Wednesday, May 23, <a href=#>interview</a> with <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> on SiriusXM’s <a href=#>Radio Andy</a>. “Before I go on a talk show, you know, he’d be like, ‘Yeah, you can say something about me if you want.’ And it was like, I didn’t normally talk about relationships and those things, and he actually didn’t mind it, or kind of liked it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/andy-cohen-olivia-munn.jpg><p>Munn and Rodgers, 34, <a href=#>split</a> in April 2017 after three years of dating. A source previously told Us Weekly that the NFL quarterback’s rift with his family was partly due to his relationship with the Newsroom star. A second insider told Us that at the time of the split Rodgers <a href=#>still wasn’t speaking to his family.</a></p><p>Cohen asked Munn about the family drama, which made headlines after his brother <strong><a href=#>Jordan</a></strong> appeared — and subsequently won — season 12 of<a href=#> The Bachelorette</a> in 2016. The Green Bay Packers star was noticeably absent from Jordan’s hometown date with <strong><a href=#>JoJo Fletcher,</a></strong> which included his parents, <strong>Edward</strong> and <strong>Darla</strong>, and oldest brother, <strong>Luke</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers.jpg><p>“I met one brother, the one who was on The Bachelorette, Jordan. I was friendly with Jordan,” she explained. “I met the parents only a couple times, and before he and I started dating, he hadn’t spoken to the parents and one brother for like eight months.”</p><p>“I remember my last day on The Newsroom … I spent the last day in my trailer, just encouraging him to have an honest conversation with your parents,” Munn continued. “And they had a nice conversation and they started coming out, my first year when I was in Green Bay in 2014 and then, um…”</p><p>“It just went South?” Cohen said. “You tried.”</p><p>Munn did not get into the specifics of what happened between her ex and his family, but implied that it had something to do with fame and football.</p><p>“I just think it’s really important to try to mend things in a family, and I encourage that … I do believe that family and fame and success can be really complicated if they’re dreams are connected to your success,” Munn said. “His father played football and is a sports chiropractor … They’re all in sports, and Aaron is one of the best, if not the best, quarterback to ever play the game. Their work has a direct connection to what he does.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: “At the end of their day there’s a lot of complications. I don’t think either side of the road is clean. But I do think it’s not OK when you try to stand on someone’s shoulders and then throw dirt in their face, which is what I think they did with him.”</p><p>Us exclusively confirmed in April that Munn<a href=#> moved on from Rodgers with Spanish actor <strong>Alex Gonzalez</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The football pro, for his part, started dating <strong><a href=#>Danica Patrick</a> </strong>in January. The Office Christmas Party actress told Cohen that her and Rodgers are “not really” in touch since the split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopJmrtqJ5zK6lp2WfpbKvv4yup2aZkqTCtXnAmqmopl2nvKWzxKuqZpmemXqptdJmnZqlmaHGbrDRmqSaZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

"You love the Green Bay Packers, and one of the reasons might be… you have a boyfriend, and that boyfriend is [Packers quarterback] Aaron Rodgers."</p><p>"Yeah, that would be the reason I'm a Packers fan," noted Munn, 34, who is best friends with Meyers' wife Alexi Ashe. "That's a good assessment!"</p><p>She went on to explain to Meyers how often she frequents games to watch the Super Bowl champ in action. "Every home game, I am there," she revealed. "When there's an away game, that's when I leave to do my work."</p><p>When Munn is present in Green Bay, Wisconsin, she's a riot. "I think I'm a good fan," the Newsroom star mused to Meyers. "I'm there and I'm screaming a lot. I think it's really important to scream and my acupuncturist told me energy follows thought. That was a very Hollywood sentence for you guys."</p><p>The only time she clams up? "When the offense is out there, it's important to be very quiet," Munn remarked. Another game day revelation recently made by the actress last month was that she and Rodgers, 31, <a href=#>do not have sex</a> on game day mornings. "No we don't. Not on game day," she said on Watch What Happens Live in December. "There's not a rule, but it just doesn't happen because there's other things to focus on."</p><p>Sometimes, however, they will sneak in a session after a win. "Depends on how late the game is," Munn joked to Andy Cohen. "Usually I try to have sex as much as I can."</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us Weekly </strong>broke the news</a> last May that Munn and Rodgers were dating, shortly after she had split from RoboCop star <strong>Joel Kinnaman</strong>. The interest in the couple from curious fans has helped fuel Google — at least, according to her mother.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Munn told Meyers Wednesday that her mom had a theory about Google's monetization methods off the celebrity couple. "She said, 'Hey, you know, I was looking online and Google makes so much money off Aaron Rodgers/Olivia Munn stories,'" Munn recalled. "She thinks Google's a website! She doesn't think it's a search engine. She actually thinks it's a place that you go."</p><p>The actress didn't confirm whether she will be supporting Rodgers come Sunday, Jan. 18, when the Green Bay Packers play defending Super Bowl champs Seattle Seahawks for the NFC title.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaopJmrtqJ5zK6lp2Wjqr2xu9GtqmaZkae8r3nRqJugnaKoeqLAjJ6tnqqpYr2ir8qeqaxlmKS6pnnGmqSeZWJlfnZ9l2pm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

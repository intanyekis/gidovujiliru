The Booksmart director was married to Italian-American filmmaker <strong>Tao Ruspoli</strong> from 2003 to 2011, while the Saturday Night Live alum was married to screenwriter and filmmaker <strong>Kay Cannon</strong> from 2004 to 2010.</p><p>During a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the Horrible Bosses star dished on his first interaction with Wilde.</p><p>“I actually came off looking a lot cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends that weren’t exactly her best girlfriends, that would report back, ‘Oh, you know, I think she’s dating someone,’ so I didn’t make any sort of moves,” he recalled at the time. “I was just very, very busy with other things.”</p><p>The former House actress, for her part, opened up how her separation from Ruspoli led her to Sudeikis in <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>’s April 2013 cover story. “I had grown up with Tao; we had just drifted. I felt I had something to prove,” she explained at the time. “If you fall off a horse, you get back up. I am not a quitter. I hung on for as long as possible, until it was more hurtful to stay.”</p><p>Wilde continued, “I’m so grateful for the pain and the heartbreak. It gave me the courage to leave and brought me to the great love of my life.”</p><p>The Tron: Legacy star also told the publication that she <a href=#>wasn’t necessarily looking for love</a> when she first met Sudeikis, adding, “I was just learning to be by myself; I’d been divorced nine months. We were both seeing people but were single. He seemed to really see me, see through the bulls–t.”</p><p>Wilde and Sudeikis announced their engagement in 2013. They are now <a href=#>parents of son Otis and daughter Daisy</a>.</p><p>Speaking to Net-a-Porter’s <a href=#>Porter Edit</a> in February 2016, Wilde explained how she believed becoming a parent alongside Sudeikis was a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot.</p><p>“We are seriously connected,” she said. “Before you have a child, <a href=#>marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise</a> to one another, and then once you have a child, it’s like, ‘Oh, we’re committed and promised already.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in November 2020 that the longtime couple’s romance came to an end.</p><p>Scroll down to see a complete timeline of Wilde and Sudeikis’ romance throughout the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvK211aKYZq%2BZobGmecCnm2aikai8r3nSrpueoZuewG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

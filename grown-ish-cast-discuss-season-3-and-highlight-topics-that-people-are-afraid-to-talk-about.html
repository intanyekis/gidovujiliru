"The show wouldn’t be relatable if we somehow ignored that or tried to act as if it didn’t exist,”</p><p>“I feel like [now] more than ever, our peer group, we’re getting so involved in politics and standing up for ourselves and using our voices, and I think it’s really important that what you see on TV is representing that and is being portrayed, so I’m happy that we’re on a show that does that,” she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>“These are things that every kid our age is going through,” agreed&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>Luka Sabbat,</span><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;who plays Luca Hall. “We live in a very political time.

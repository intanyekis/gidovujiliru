The singer seems to be hurt and bitter that their ex-partner has a new job, new hair, and a new guy, and wonders if they care about the singer's feelings at all. The lyrics "Do you think I care / About your new job and your new hair / Do you think I cry / 'Bout your new friends and your new guy / I do" effectively convey the singer's sense of betrayal and abandonment.</p><br><p>The chorus of the song serves as a warning to the ex-partner, reminding them to watch their tone and watch their mouth when speaking to the singer, who seems to have become emotionally unstable. The line "Slide a drink across the table / Watch it fall onto the ground / Keep your distance she's unstable / Watch your tone and watch your mouth" creates a sense of tension and unease, implying that the singer may lash out if provoked.</p><br><p>The final verse of the song speaks to the singer's feelings of inadequacy and worthlessness in the relationship, with lines like "Was I just a waste of time" and "All you do is scratch and bite." The repetition of the phrase "Take my love" at the end of the song implies that the singer is struggling to let go of their feelings for their ex-partner, even though it seems like they have already moved on.</p><br><p>Overall, "Watch Your Mouth" is a powerful and emotional song that effectively captures the pain and heartbreak that can come with the end of a relationship.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Do you think I care</u><br>The singer is questioning whether their level of concern is of any importance to the person they are addressing.</p><br><p><u>About your new job and your new hair</u><br>The singer is indicating that they are not interested in the new developments in the other person's life.</p><br><p><u>Do you think I cry</u><br>The singer is questioning if they should be upset about the other person's choices and actions.</p><br><p><u>'Bout your new friends and your new guy</u><br>The artist is indicating that they do not care about the other person's new relationships.</p><br><p><u>I do</u><br>Despite what has been said before, the artist does actually care about the other person's life changes.</p><br><p><u>Slide a drink across the table</u><br>The singer is describing a hypothetical scenario where they give the other person a drink.</p><br><p><u>Watch it fall onto the ground</u><br>The singer is indicating that the other person is in a fragile state and may drop or spill things easily.</p><br><p><u>Keep your distance she's unstable</u><br>The artist is warning others to stay away from the other person as they are emotionally unstable.</p><br><p><u>Watch your tone and watch your mouth</u><br>The artist is advising others to be careful with their words and tone when speaking to the other person.</p><br><p><u>Left all your records at your mother's place</u><br>The artist is indicating that the other person has abandoned things they used to enjoy and left them at their mother's house.</p><br><p><u>They only would've slapped you in the face</u><br>The singer is suggesting that the other person's past interests were not worth pursuing and may have caused them harm.</p><br><p><u>At least your Instagram is up to date</u><br>The artist is acknowledging that the other person has kept their social media updated despite other areas of their life not being in place.</p><br><p><u>Better check your facts before you flip the page</u><br>The singer is advising the other person to be sure of their choices and actions before making changes or moving on from the past.</p><br><p><u>Wait, in line</u><br>The singer is indicating that the other person should be patient and wait their turn for something.</p><br><p><u>Cause you're not alone, no</u><br>The singer is acknowledging that the other person is not the only one in a certain situation or experiencing certain emotions.</p><br><p><u>You're mine</u><br>The artist is expressing a possessive sentiment towards the other person.</p><br><p><u>I bet you never take your time</u><br>The artist is suggesting that the other person rushes through things and does not take enough time to consider their choices or actions.</p><br><p><u>All you do is scratch and bite</u><br>The singer is describing the other person's behavior as aggressive and reactionary.</p><br><p><u>Was I just a waste of time</u><br>The singer is questioning whether their time spent with the other person was worth anything or simply a waste.</p><br><p><u>Take my love</u><br>The artist is offering their love to the other person.</p><br><p><u>And throw it all out</u><br>The artist is anticipating the other person discarding or disregarding their love.</p><br><p><u>Owoah</u><br>A nonsensical word used as an exclamation or intensifier.</p><br><p><u>Owoah</u><br>A nonsensical word used as an exclamation or intensifier.</p><br><p><u>Owoah</u><br>A nonsensical word used as an exclamation or intensifier.</p><br><p><u>Owoah</u><br>A nonsensical word used as an exclamation or intensifier.</p><br><p><u>Owoah</u><br>A nonsensical word used as an exclamation or intensifier.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Writer(s): Ethan John Christensen, Jonas Tyler Swanson, Jonathon Taylor Welch, Joshua Robert Harmon</span></p><p>Contributed by Bentley V.

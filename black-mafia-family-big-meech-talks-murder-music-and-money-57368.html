How was it all transported to the clubs without any major violence? I saw you guys blow at least $100,000 in one night in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br>Big Meech: </strong>What I’m saying is, everybody is happy. everybody is making money. I been around a place like Atlanta for a long time. I lived there since the 1990, been there since 1988. I didn’t have the problems other people had I been through a lot of things. Almost 90 percent of the cities I touched down in, I had nothing but love. So it was never no problems. And we don’t do no robbing, we just never had no problems. When you got a crew that’s hungry, they might turn on you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br>AllHipHop.com: </strong>You have a business acumen about yourself that’s a lot different. Where does your CEO mentality come from.&nbsp;</p><strong><br>Big Meech:</strong> That’s what I was before I left the streets, I was CEO of <a href=# id=auto-tag_bmf_3 data-tag=bmf>BMF</a>, the label.&nbsp;<p><strong><br>AllHipHop.com: </strong>I know that, but I’m saying you ended up at the top, you were in a leadership role, some people are followers.</p><p><strong>Big Meech:</strong> It always been a dream of mine, I always had a love for music growing up. Being able to bring all these brothers together and do something positive with it and not be known as some drug gang or gang members period. That’s why I consider all family. We never was a gang. All my friends were involved [in the music business], like Puff, JD, Jeezy, Slim Thug, Nelly. These people were involved in music and it made me want to be more hands on. I seen how a lot of artists was getting jerked at the time and still are today and that’s something I was going to change, once I got my foot all through the door. But the government seen me with my foot almost closing the door and they end up giving me these trumped up charges.</p><p><strong>AllHipHop.com:</strong> The advertisements you had popping off in Atlanta for years –</p><p><strong><br>Big Meech:</strong> Yeah I had four of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e5oq%2FKZqSanpmWeqetzKKjsmWSnrRuucSemqFlpJa5rL%2BMpqyrnJWneq7B0qKaZpmemXquu82esGZtZ2iDeXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

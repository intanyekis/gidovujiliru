Her boyfriend Travis Kelce didn’t attend. Rather, she took her friend Keleigh Teller (the wife of Miles Teller) as her date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this shouldn’t necessarily be taken as an indication of trouble in paradise. One report says Travis skipped the awards show due to his own work obligations. While Taylor was at the show, Travis was on the sidelines of the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers, which they won with only a single point lead.</p><p>It was suspected that Travis may choose the Golden Globes if he was benched, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which was so to prevent injury ahead of next week’</a>s playoffs. Several other high-profile players like Patrick Mahomes and Rashee Rice were also benched. Nevertheless, Travis clearly felt the need to be there in-person to support his team, even if Taylor was elsewhere.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_every-emma-stone-movie-that-has-grossed-over-100-million-at-the-box-office_bk_a2_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Every Emma Stone Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>After having taken home an Oscar for Best Lead actress, Emma Stone is continuing to solidify herself as one of the greatest of our generation</span><p>Travis has been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vocal about how much he appreciates Taylor’s support</a> of his career. Reports say the couple both try to respect each other’s careers, despite how demanding their schedules are. Moreover, though they only debuted their romance in the summer, Travis and Taylor have been dodging engagement rumors for months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's quickly turning more serious.

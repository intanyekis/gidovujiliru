The Chicago actress is reportedly dating the show’s&nbsp;host <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ant Anstead</a></strong>, just nine months after Ant separated from his wife, Flip or Flop star <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Christina Haack</a> </strong>according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>. Renee and Ant reportedly met while shooting the Celebrity IOU: Joyride episode, which is set to be a six episode spin-off series. After they wrapped, the Academy Award-winning actress went back to give Ant a pair of work boots — but it’s not clear when they actually started dating.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ant and Christina split up in September 2020, later filing for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce in November 2020.</a> The couple’s divorce was finalized on Monday June 21, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News.</a> Christina and the former Wheeler Dealers host have one son together <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hudson London Anstead.</strong></a> In a post following the split, Christina penned a lengthy message about “breaking the pattern” to her Instagram account. Ironically, she mentioned that she’d wanted to be a sports agent “like Jerry Maguire” before getting into real estate and subsequently TV — and one of Renee’s early breakthrough roles was playing Dorothy Boyd in the Cameron Crowe movie about a sports agent.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/renee-zellweger-dating-ant-anstead-mega-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before getting together with Ant, Renee’s last relationship was with musician&nbsp;<strong>Doyle Bramhall II.&nbsp;</strong>The pair were together from 2012 until 2019. The couple had reportedly gotten engaged back in June 2016, but never officially tied the knot. The&nbsp;Bridget Jones&nbsp;actress was also married to country singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kenny Chesney</strong></a>&nbsp;in May 2005, but the relationship was short lived as the marriage was annulled only four months later. In a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>2016 interview,</a> Renee revealed that she’d forgotten that they’d gotten married.

And then probably be canceled, almost immediately,” she said, adding, “Actually, most of the characters on that show would be canceled by now. That show is so inappropriate now,” Kaling said. “The writers who I’m still in touch with now, we always talk about how so much of that show we probably couldn’t make now.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Tastes have changed and, honestly, what offends people has changed so much now. I think that actually is one of the reasons the show is popular, because people feel like there’s something kind of fearless about it or taboo that it talks about on the show.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When asked if she would ever show her breakout role as Kapoor to her kids, she replied defiantly: “I kind of think maybe never.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/GettyImages-1237058823.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere regarding other NBC-related properties, SZA recently&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>performed “Blind” and “Shirt”</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The tracks are set to be featured on her upcoming album,&nbsp;S.O.S, which is scheduled to drop on Dec. 9. Earlier last month, the songstress gave insight to her mindset after this body of work.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I feel like music, in this capacity, I don’t see longevity.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>I like to create, I like to write</a>, I like to sing, and I like to share,” SZA told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Billboard</a>. “But I don’t know if chasing after superstardom or whatever I’m supposed to be doing right now is sustainable for me or for anybody. I’mma take a good swing at it, and I’mma give ’em my absolute best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K2r7DYZqKapJmjtG7Ax55kqJ6WnrCmedOopmahnpa9sb7OqamimaSaenJ%2Bkm1uam5mZYZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

He played high school and college-level football, and his impressive performances led to his entry into the 2007 NFL Draft. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In May 2007, he was signed to the Minnesota Vikings franchise and went to Canadian Football League in 2008 but was released from his team in November 2008. He also retired from football shortly after and joined professional wrestling, and continued the Samoan legacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Reigns never turned away from a challenge and battled everyone from Brock Lesnar to John Cena, resulting in an impressive list of accolades. He has held the WWE Championship thrice, the WWE Intercontinental Championship once, and the WWE Universal Championship twice.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In 2016, Reigns was also ranked as the number one pro wrestler out of the top 500 single wrestlers in Pro Wrestling Illustrated'sIll'nual PWI 500 list. He has made a lasting impression, but much of it could all be owed to his family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As the son of WWE Hall of Famer Sika, he was born into the famous Wild Samoan wrestling family.

However, by April 1980, they claimed their first World Tag Team Championship and held it for almost four months.&nbsp;</p><p>Their second championship lasted two months, while their third and final title reign was longest at just over eight months. Throughout those periods, they battled the likes of Tony Garea & Rick Martel, Bob Backlund & Pedro Morales, The Strongbow’s, and even cousin Rocky Johnson.</p><p>But it was the team of Johnson & Tony Atlas that took over the reign of The Wild Samoans. The Anoa’i brothers significantly impacted the ring and continued to do so through their training and managerial services once their time in the ring ended.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>They have trained many WWE superstars, including former WWE Champion Yokozuna and former WWE Superstars Rikishi, Tonga Kid, Virgil, Michael P.S.

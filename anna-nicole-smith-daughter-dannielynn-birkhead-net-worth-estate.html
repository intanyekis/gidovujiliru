First off, there have been a lot of questions about <a href=#>whether Jenner actually is a billionaire or not</a>. Secondly, a lot of people took exception to the idea that anyone would label Jenner self-made. After all, even though there is no doubt that Jenner has made the most of her opportunities, much to her credit, it also is clear that her family’s fame opened a lot of doors for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, just because some people have been adamant that Kylie Jenner isn’t self-made doesn’t mean that people resent other stars who’ve inherited a lot of money. In fact, most people don’t care about <a href=#>the money that some stars inherited</a>. For proof of that, all you have to do is look at the fact that Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ family is incredibly rich and her millions of fans couldn’t care less. On the other hand, when a celebrity passes away, a lot of their fans are interested to learn how much money their kids inherit. For example, a lot of the people who followed Anna Nicole Smith’s career and life are interested to know how much money her daughter got from her estate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Inherited More From Kurt Cobain: Frances Bean Or Courtney Love?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anna-nicole-smith-battles-for-a-huge-fortune>Anna Nicole Smith Battles For A Huge Fortune</h2><p>A couple of years after Anna Nicole Smith first rose to fame, the world was shocked to learn that she’d married a man named J. Howard Marshall. After all, Smith was 26-years-old when she and Marshall were wed and he was 89-years-old at the time. Of course, the tabloids were fascinated by the marriage for a couple of reasons. First off, the fact that Marshall was more than 62 years older than Smith raised a lot of eyebrows. On top of that, Marshall was a businessman, academic, lawyer, and government official whose involvement in the petroleum industry made him a billionaire.</p><p>When most people learned about Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall’s marriage, they jumped to an obvious conclusion, she walked down the aisle to try to get her hands on his money. Assumptions aside, members of Marshall’s family made it publically known that they believed Smith was a gold digger. Of course, there is no way for random observers to know for sure what was going on in Smith’s mind when she married Marshall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Tori Spelling's Family Money After Her Dad Passed Away?</a></span></p><p>After 14 months of Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall married, the elderly billionaire passed away. When that news hit the press, virtually everyone presumed that Smith was going to cash in. However, Marshall revised his will shortly before his passing and removed Smith and one of his sons from it. After that revelation, Smith and Marshall’s son, who was cut out of the will, teamed up to sue the billionaire’s estate for a piece of the pie. Ultimately, all of those legal efforts dragged on for years which meant that Smith’s estate took them up after her passing. After years battling it out in court, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith’s estate won no money</a> from its efforts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter Remembers Her Mom</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-anna-nicole-smith-rsquo-s-daughter-inherit>How Much Money Did Anna Nicole Smith’s Daughter Inherit?</h2><p>When Anna Nicole Smith suddenly passed away, there was a protracted legal battle over who would take custody of her daughter Dannielynn. Even though it should have been clear to everyone that Dannielynn’s welfare is what mattered, the media framed the lawsuits around one thing, money. The main reason for that is the fact that a lot of people still believed that Smith’s estate could receive a fortune from its efforts against J. Howard Marshall’s beneficiaries. Ultimately, Dannielynn’s biological father Larry Birkhead would win custody of the child and he gave his daughter his last name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Anna Nicole Smith’s estate never got a piece of the money that J. Howard Marshall left behind, Dannielynn Birkhead still got a nice chunk of change from her mother. After all, Smith was a highly successful model, actor, and “reality” TV star during her life. As a result, <a href=#>Smith left behind an estimated $700,00 for her daughter Dannielynn</a> according to reports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping in mind how much money Anna Nicole Smith left behind, it will likely surprise people that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dannielynn and her father Larry are now worth $3 million </a>according to celebritynetworth.com. However, that number makes a lot of sense once people look into the situation further. After all, through inflation alone, the money Smith left behind would be worth more today. On top of that Dannielynn has worked as a model for Guess Kids and Smith’s certainly estate got a new infusion of cash when old images of Anna Nicole were used for a recent Guess campaign.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Was Anna Nicole Smith's Recent Guess Campaign In Poor Taste?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp6aRYruqr86lnGarnZ7BqXnDmqygoKSav26wwKelop2crruvecGiqaSglZaxbrrErWSwp6KptW6x0q2YrZ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

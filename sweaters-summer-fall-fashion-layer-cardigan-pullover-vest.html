In some ways, we’re excited about it, but on the other hand, we feel like we just got started wearing all of our cutest summer looks!</p><p>Can it really already be time to start storing our tank tops and mini skirts away for the next few seasons? Maybe not quite yet. If you have a summer outfit you adore, you don’t necessarily have to give it up the second a chilly breeze blows past. You might just need to add a sweater! We’ve picked out 17 that will help extend your summer wardrobe’s life well into fall:</p><h4>Cardigans</h4><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>We love this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Taleubie cardigan</a> because it’s a great length for wearing with both jeans and mini dresses or skirts. The chunky knit is also warm — but not too warm!</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>If you love a more streamlined look, check out this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NENONA cardigan</a>. The long column of buttons is eye-catching and dresses things up a bit!</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>Need something to simultaneously warm you up and elevate your look? This flowy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bluetime cardigan</a> is set to impress!</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>If you adore the kimono style, then definitely take a look at this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">BB&KK cardigan</a>. The florals are so pretty, but it comes in many, many patterns!</p><h4>Pullovers</h4><p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Rock this color-block <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WEESO sweater</a> with shorts and white <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>. When it gets cold, switch to jeans and booties!</p><p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>This wide-neck&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ROSKIKI sweater</a> is so soft and lovely. It’s also literally adorned in stars!</p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PRETTYGARDEN sweater</a> has a unique stripe pattern that will have all of your friends wondering where you shop. Imagine their reaction when you tell them it’s from Amazon!</p><p><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong>This puff-sleeve&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Drop sweater</a> is “cloud-soft” and totally trendy. It comes in multiple colors too!</p><h4>Short-Sleeve Sweaters</h4><p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>Short-sleeve sweaters make for great transitional pieces. This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Saodimallsu sweater</a> has a pointelle design you’ll want to rock all year long!</p><p><strong>10.&nbsp;</strong>The mock neckline on this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Anbenser sweater</a> automatically upgrades your look. The fitted design makes it great for tucking into distressed denim shorts or a flared skirt!</p><p><strong>11.&nbsp;</strong>This swiss dot&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Foshow sweater</a> will have compliments flying your way. Slip it on and you’re instantly stylish!</p><p><strong>12. </strong>Get a little fancy with some cashmere! This V-neck&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DAIMIDY sweater</a>is totally soft and lovely!</p><h4>Sweater Vests</h4><p><strong>13. </strong>Sweater vests are having a major fashion moment right now, and this is a great time of year to rock them. This plaid&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Balaflyie sweater vest</a> is a must!</p><p><strong>14. </strong>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hyipels sweater vest</a> is the perfect mix of summer and fall. Sunflowers for summer, soft, knit material for fall!</p><p><strong>15. </strong>We’re obsessed with the windowpane plaid print on this&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SheIn sweater vest</a>. The cropped fit is a wonderful bonus too!</p><p><strong>16.&nbsp;</strong>We love this button-up <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Belle Poque sweater vest</a> for multiple reasons. First, we obviously love the cherry print, and second, we love that we can always unbutton it for a totally different look!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>17.&nbsp;</strong>Love a cable knit but too warm for a full-on sweater? Check out this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fisoew sweater vest</a> instead!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOrK6emaSav7R50q6kpp2iYrOiuMtmnZqrmJ68r3nLmrCeql2YrrOwyKCYp2Wgqrmtu9WeqWaulajBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

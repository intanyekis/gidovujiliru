The trending news surrounding the Home Depot Girl and the alleged backlash she is receiving from other women is being analyzed by HOLR.</p><p>User @freekdagemini posted a TikTok video discussing the viral fame of the Home Depot Girl. It is reported that she is now facing criticism on Twitter from adult film stars due to her online recognition. Initially, she received praise for being a hardworking woman who doesn’t engage in online activities, as evidenced by her caption: “The one job I work at that I’m reminded I’m too pretty to work at.”</p><a title=@freekdagemini href=# rel=noopener>@freekdagemini</a><p><a title=twitter href=# rel=noopener>#twitter</a> <a title=women href=# rel=noopener>#women</a> <a title=homedepotgirl href=# rel=noopener>#homedepotgirl</a> <a title=foryou href=# rel=noopener>#foryou</a> <a title=supportwomen href=# rel=noopener>#supportwomen</a></p><p><a title="♬ Get Off The Wall - Philly Goats" href=# rel=noopener>♬ Get Off The Wall – Philly Goats</a></p><p>However, other women on social media are now expressing their discontent, stating that her job at Home Depot is not something worth showcasing, and they fail to understand the hype around it. Despite this backlash, she received a direct message from Shaquille O’Neal, reassuring her not to worry about the haters.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Yo my faucet needs oilin. Which HD U @?</p><p>— Indy1 (@dblak) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 10, 2023</a></p><p>This situation raises the question of why women are not supporting each other in this context.</p><p>The Home Depot Girl on TikTok is identified as Ariana Josephine. She has gained attention on Twitter for being considered “too pretty.” Ariana has been praised for her faith, sense of fashion, and her studies at the University of Houston. She works at Home Depot to earn what she considers the “right money,” as mentioned in one of her tweets.</p><p>On Twitter, numerous users have discussed Ariana’s beauty and commended her for not pursuing a career in modeling but instead focusing on her studies and finding alternative ways to improve her finances. However, she has also faced criticism from several internet users for indirectly comparing herself to models and adult entertainment workers, suggesting that not all money is “good money.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know shawty a good woman… she coulda made an onlyfans but she got a real job and it’s an honest living <a href=#>https://t.co/Dt69FletNv</a></p><p>— Ivan (@Hovshelper) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 9, 2023</a></p><p>Ariana’s posts have ignited a debate among social media users regarding societal expectations and standards imposed on women who are considered “pretty.”</p><p>Ariana Josephine’s individual tweets have caused a stir on Twitter. Some users praised and supported her for striving to succeed without relying on her looks, while others took issue with her vague statements.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is insane. Creepy men are stalking that Home Depot girl..finding her address and personal info and now other men are in the comments joking about it and telling her to tell the police instead of twitter. They went from praising her to blaming her…</p><p>— the stud that got beat up at waffle house 🧇 (@alesiavsworld) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 12, 2023</a></p><p>Her initial post addressed comments she received about being too pretty to work at Home Depot. Many netizens supported her decision to work instead of pursuing modeling or other industries. However, Ariana’s subsequent tweets seemed to trigger negative reactions, particularly when she made comments about the adult entertainment sector. Numerous women expressed their disagreement with her stance.</p><p>Ariana’s viral status can be attributed to the backlash she received for her remarks, which were misinterpreted by some users. Her responses to the criticism made her famous on TikTok as the Home Depot Girl, and many creators have made videos addressing the issue of women tearing each other down in the comments section.</p><p>TikTokers are engaging with these videos to highlight gender disparities and promote the ideal concept of “women supporting women.”</p><p>It is not uncommon for women, such as the Home Depot Girl, to receive both praise and condemnation for being deemed “too pretty” to work. Another example is Regina Jay, also known as Jiggly TikTok Girl, who gained attention for her fashion advice and faith-centered content.</p><p>Regina Jay’s nickname “Jiggly” originated from a comment about her posterior being too prominent in her videos, to which she responded by embracing it. Similar to the Home Depot Girl, Regina was praised for her involvement in her faith and her choice to pursue a “real career” instead of modeling. However, Regina opted not to create a Twitter account to avoid unnecessary hate in the long run.</p><p>Following the viral post by Home Depot Girl, her story reached the attention of renowned NBA icon Shaquille O’Neal. Inspired by her experience, Shaquille decided to visit a local Home Depot and generously purchase a variety of items for random individuals.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaq went to Home Depot and bought this family a washer and dryer 💪 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/m86MSnWQu8</a></p><p>— NBACentral (@TheNBACentral) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 14, 2023</a></p><p>Complex, a reputable source, reported that amidst the criticism she faced on social media, the young woman received a direct message from NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal. In the message, he provided words of encouragement during the chaos on social media.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shaq DM’d the Home Depot girl 😭 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jqda28GZIu</a></p><p>— Legion Hoops (@LegionHoops) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 11, 2023</a></p><p>In his message, Shaquille advised Cossie not to let the negative comments affect her mental well-being, stating, “Don’t read the comments; stuff like that will drive you crazy.” Adding a touch of humor, he concluded, “Have a great day, and tell all your boyfriends I said hello lol.”</p><p>In response, Cossie expressed her gratitude with a lighthearted reply, stating, “HAHA, I will thank you!!” and reciprocating the well wishes by saying, “You too!”</p><p>Ariana Josephine’s case seems to be following a similar pattern, with some people supporting her choices while others oppose them. Her viral status is predominantly due to her beauty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51ktbC5xGabnqifqXqotdGlZKCnlah6t7XRmqNmp55iwbi1062cq2WRo7FuwMikq6ijXZa6qrCMrJ%2BaqpmjtG68x6irqKtdq7alsc5o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

Halsey launched her brand About-Face in February 2021, and the company offers a <a href=#>wide range of beauty products</a> in a colorful range of products and shades. Selling products made to have fun, Halsey has put years of dedication to building a brand and engaging her loyal customers. The singer sells environmentally-conscious products and uses several techniques to keep growing her brand. <a href=#>While Halsey currently has a $20 million fortune</a>, it is all set to skyrocket with the fast-selling products offered by About-Face.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halsey has put a lot of herself into building About-Face, a company made from passion and dreams. There were various causes why customers and fans are drawn to her product that go beyond Halsey’s celebrity status. Let’s take a look at how Halsey continues to grow her band, About-Face.</p><h2 id=highlighting-diversity-and-freedom>Highlighting Diversity And Freedom</h2><p>Inspired by the 90s, there is one sentiment commonly shared by her and her fans that make-up is for everyone. When people are looking for ways to express themselves, Halsey wanted the brand to highlight the diversity and improve self-confidence through innovative products, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>. As make-up can be used by people of any gender, race, or size, customers have appreciated her spirit to create a brand that embraces uniqueness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Ways Christina Aguilera Earns And Spends Her Millions</a></span></p><h2 id=wide-range-of-cruelty-free-and-vegan-products>Wide Range Of Cruelty-Free And Vegan Products</h2><p>Beauty is not only about looking the best but also being socially responsible. As the generation has shifted to a demographic of using <a href=#>cruelty-free, vegan products</a>, customers are looking to support brands that do not perform animal testing and do not contain animal-derived ingredients. About-Face has established itself as a reliable brand that has ethically-sourced products.</p><h2 id=not-looking-for-perfection>Not Looking For Perfection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halsey has always embraced imperfection. As the singer suffers from chronic illness, she also accepts the body the way it is. More recently, she shared snapshots of her postpartum body as a way to show her fans to learn acceptance. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper Magazine</a>, Halsey’s make-up line for About-Face has the main motto for people to flaunt their imperfections. The impactful words have resonated with people, and the make-up line was sold out within days of its release.</p><h2 id=engaging-direct-to-customer>Engaging Direct-To-Customer</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Launching an interactive and engaging website is essential for creating a branding experience. Halsey is known to engage with her fans through social media, and her brand also has a direct-to-customer experience through the website. About-Face joined hands with beauty retailer Cult Beauty to promote and ship their products in the international market to go global. This decision was made through meticulous planning as the brand first established a rapport with the US Market for ten months before deciding to launch internationally.</p><h2 id=offering-year-long-partnerships>Offering Year-Long Partnerships</h2><p>Along with selling products on the website and through international online retailers, About-Face has partnered with Ipsy. This company gives monthly personalized subscription offers in the world of make-up. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a>, customers can get year-long subscriptions to the brand with exclusive offers that other customers do not yet receive. The exclusive deal will ensure that Ipsy customers are the first ones to get their products shipped and delivered. This experience has not only created a solid customer base but is also an excellent measure to retain them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=challenging-beauty-standards>Challenging Beauty Standards</h2><p>Every person has their way of becoming their fabulous selves. These lines have engaged the customers on the website to keep coming and shop the make-up and beauty products. Halsey explained in an interview that she finds videos and images of fans on the internet that use her make-up in <a href=#>unique ways to show their beauty</a>. As someone who is unapologetically herself, Halsey knows that the beauty industry has its norms, but she has allowed the fans to challenge these standards and be themselves.</p><h2 id=unique-selection-of-colors>Unique Selection Of Colors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having complete knowledge of brands, best-in-class products, and application methods, Halsey calls herself a make-up junkie. Halsey has always done her make-up for events and doesn’t mind showing her creative side. The singer wants people to lean into every dimension of themselves, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>. With each make-up line, Halsey has introduced new color shades from glittery green to unique shades of purple.</p><h2 id=supporting-social-causes>Supporting Social Causes</h2><p>Everyone loves a brand that supports social causes. As already a philanthropist who has helped many communities across the world, Halsey has introduced Giving Tuesday at About-Face, where 5% of the sales on Tuesdays are donated to two organizations, Every Mom Counts, a non-profit dedicated to making childcare and pregnancy safe everywhere, and The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention community for the LGBTQ+ youth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>About-Face has <a href=#>become a multi-dimensional brand</a> that caters to youth from various backgrounds and offers products that let them be their unique self. Providing affordable products that are also safe for the environment, Halsey has worked hard to make her brand sustainable in the beauty industry. About-Face is all set to drop its tenth collection in February 2022.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>8 Ways Ryan Gosling Earns And Spends His Millions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paper Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSFbsPAsqpmoZ5ixKm1wqFkoZmcqLK6ecarnLBlmJq%2FbrnUpauiZZ2eua21zqdknaecoa6zecWaqqGhn6N6o77Ap5tmmZKkwrV5xZqanmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

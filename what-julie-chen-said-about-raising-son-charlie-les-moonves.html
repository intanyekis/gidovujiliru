Today, he’s twelve years old and, due to his parents, was born in the limelight. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His father is a multimillionaire with an estimated $700 million net worth</a>, and Julie has a $16 million net worth. Together as a family, they live a lavish lifestyle, and some may say that children born into a celebrity household grow up entitled. It all depends on how much time parents spend with their children and what they teach them.

Her grandmother tried to have Julie’s father raise one of her male cousins to carry on the family name. However, Julie’s mother said no and allowed her strong daughter to carry on the name. To this day, Juile kept her maiden name and added her husband’s last name to the end, becoming Julie Chen Moonves. They named their son Charlie Moonves, but he looks like his mother and can carry the Chen family bloodline into new generations.</p><h2 id=julie-leaves-39-the-talk-39><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Julie Leaves 'The Talk'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Julie left The Talk with a heartfelt broadcast</a> after her husband stepped down from his CBS executive position. She’s co-hosted the talk show for nine years since the day it first aired and refers to the cast and crew as family. She said, "Right now, I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son, so I've decided to leave The Talk." She tears up as she states, "to everyone behind the scenes, I send you my love, and I will miss you all very, very much." Her absence from the show caused a lot of disappointment, but she had the best intentions of freeing up time to spend with her family and raise Charlie.</p><h2 id=motherhood-is-not-overrated><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Motherhood Is Not Overrated</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julie once told BuzzFeed, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I never wanted kids, and I never wanted to get married</a>." She changed her tune in the early 2000s as she got married and pregnant. For the most part, she’s kept Charlie’s life out of the spotlight, but from social media posts, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s embracing motherhood</a> and mom life. <a href=#>She calls Big Brother her child</a> as well and jokingly says, "I mean, at some point, I hope it goes on without me if I’m six feet under, and I’m not hoping for that. Or pass it on to my son, I’ve told them.

She openly admitted to getting plastic surgery after an executive and her agent said she’d never become a news anchor due to her eyes. She had a blepharoplasty to fix her "heavy eyelids" and improve her chances of appearing on television. She said that as Charlie gets older, he is showing signs of shunning his Asian heritage. He has little interest in learning Mandarin or about his roots. Julie told Us Weekly, "I know he’ll reach a stage where he’s going to regret not learning the language and speaking it fluently from a young age. He will want to get in touch with his Chinese roots."</p><h2 id=writing-letters-to-charlie><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Writing Letters To Charlie</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Julie started a tradition of writing letters to her son when he was one year old for him to open in the future. Julie said, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We’ll save them until he’s 21, 25, or whenever he’s mature enough to appreciate what he means to us</a>."</p><p>Chen and her husband do not plan on spoiling Charlie with gifts and say toys are meaningless to him (probably because he already has so many). On holidays, Charlie will get letters in place of gifts as Julie said, "As his first birthday approached, I remember thinking, What are we going to do to celebrate? What do you get for a 1-year-old? Toys? Whatever. Our letters are our gift."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Did Julie Chen Take A Dig At Ellen DeGeneres?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYre2uMieZJyglaN6tK3InWSamp%2BqwW6%2BwKKqoqaXYsCwuoycn5qqnJ6ybrjErGSmp5%2Bjw6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

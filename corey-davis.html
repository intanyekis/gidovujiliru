He was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft, 5th overall. He played four seasons with the Titans, before signing with the New York Jets in 2021. He played two seasons with the Jets.</p><p>In his career, Davis caught 273 passes for 3,879 yards and 17 touchdowns. He had his best season in 2018 when he caught 65 passes for 984 yards and 5 touchdowns.</p><p>Davis announced his retirement from the NFL on August 23, 2023. He was still under contract with the Jets for one more season, but he decided to step away from the game.</p><p><strong>Here is a breakdown of Davis’ career stats:</strong></p><ul><li>Seasons played: 6</li><li>Games played: 95</li><li>Receptions: 273</li><li>Yards: 3,879</li><li>Touchdowns: 17</li></ul><p>Davis was a talented wide receiver who had the potential to be a star in the NFL. However, he was never able to consistently put up big numbers, and he was also plagued by injuries. His retirement is a bit of a surprise, but he is still young and has plenty of time to pursue other interests.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Corey_Davis_News></span><strong>Corey Davis News </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Aaron Rodgers’ abrupt departure hurts the New York Jets as he loses his weapon before the season.<br>The number two wide receiver for Aaron Rodgers and a top-five pick in the 2016 NFL Draught has opted to retire in his prime, dealing a blow to the New York Jets.</strong></p><p>At the age of 28, wide receiver for the New York Jets Corey Davis has made the decision to leave the NFL.</p><p>For the Jets and new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Davis was recently expected to be the starting wide receiver, but he has opted to leave the game. Davis provided an explanation for his choice to retire despite being in his prime in a message published on his social media channels.</p><p>He stated: “I’ve been thinking about leaving the game of football for a while now. Making this choice has not been simple.</p><p>“Even though I’m a thoughtful person, I tend to speak with few words. I’ve been trying to figure out what to do, and I think the best course for me right now is to stop playing the game.</p><p>“I am more fortunate than I could ever have anticipated. I have a wonderful family, with a lovely wife and two healthy children with whom I eagerly anticipate spending more time.</p><p>“All the possibilities I have had and will continue to have on my journey, I am sincerely grateful for. I appreciate the support I’ve received from my family, friends, and the Jets organization during this time.</p><p>Davis was still slated for a significant role even though the Jets have rising youngster Garrett Wilson as their primary option and Rodgers has added his two favorite Green Bay Packers receivers, Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb, to the squad.</p><p>After Wilson immediately rose to prominence in his debut campaign, Davis, who had been the second option, finished the season with 536 yards and two touchdowns.</p><p>Former Tennessee Titans fifth-round pick Davis was expected to become a future league superstar, but he never quite reached that level after departing the team after four serviceable but unspectacular years.</p><p>The Jets unexpectedly released second-round pick Denzel Mims earlier in the summer, and they could now be searching for more players at the position. They appeared to have found success with undrafted rookie Jacob Brownlee, who has excelled throughout training camp and has emerged as a potential team member.</p><p>Due to the addition of Breece Hall to the squad and the acquisition of Dalvin Cook, the Jets are also likely to be a run-heavy club.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Anthony Coley Wikipedia, Wife, Family, Spouse, Net Worth, Wiki, Age, Twitter</a></li><li><a href=#>Candace Rondeaux Wikipedia, Wiki, Husband, Wagner, Partner, Eyes, Twitter, Married</a></li><li><a href=#>Jasiah Mitchell Found, Missing, Update, Mother</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtom5%2Bnsrp5w5qtoqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>

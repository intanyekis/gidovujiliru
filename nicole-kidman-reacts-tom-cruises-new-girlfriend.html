"It all seems staged and bizarre to her and makes her even more thankful for her own marriage,” the insider shared.</p><p>Tom and Nicole were married from 1990 to 2001, making their union last for nearly 11 years. During their time together, they adopted two children, Isabella and Connor, who are now adults.

There have also been rumors throughout the years that the Church has had a hand in Tom’s romantic life, and Nicole’s reaction to his new partner seems to suggest she believes their relationship is merely set-up for the public’s benefit.</p><p>"Tom's shown for years he's undateable and if he thinks he's going to solve that problem by throwing money at his high-maintenance sweetie, then good luck with that,” the insider continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Nicole knows what a ham Tom is," they added.

"It's not like he can't afford to lavish this girl with the best of the best, but Nicole believes Tom's ego and bizarre lifestyle will eventually burn this romance out like all the others!"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1-7-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Here’s How Katie Holmes Is Adding To Her $15 Million Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Katie Holmes seems to be taking her career in a different direction these days behind the camera.</span><h2 id=tom-rsquo-s-girlfriend-rsquo-s-ex-husband-warned-him-about-her-motivations>Tom’s Girlfriend’s Ex-Husband Warned Him About Her Motivations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/maxresdefault-19.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tom may be romancing Elsina to prove something to the public – she’s the first woman he’s been publicly linked to in years – she may also have her own motivations for getting in a relationship with the famous actor.

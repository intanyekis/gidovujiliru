I’m not a gown’s girl; I’m more of a jumpsuits, sneakers, let’s get down and dirty [type],” Jenn, 26, says in <i>Us Weekly’s </i>exclusive sneak peek of the Monday, July 22, episode of <a href=#><i>The Bachelorette</i></a>.</p><p class=p1>Jenn invited her contestants <strong>Hakeem Moulton</strong>, <strong>Austin Ott</strong>, <strong>Aaron Erb</strong> and <strong>Jeremy Simon</strong> to a local race track in Melbourne for a high-speed group date.</p><p class=p1>“I like to get the adrenaline going and I phoned a friend. If he can’t teach you guys to drive, nobody can,” Jenn quipped to the guys, introducing local driving pro <strong>Jesse</strong> (not to be confused with show host<strong> Jesse Palmer</strong>).</p><p class=p1>As the men tentatively suited up, Hakeem, 29, realized quickly that Aaron, also 29, had a leg up on the others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bachelorette-Sneak-Peek-Jenn-Tran.jpg><p class=p1>“We’re all on the same playing field beside Aaron [because he] <a href=#>knows how to drive stick</a> [shift],” Hakeem says. “So, that’s a little competition there.”</p><p class=p1>Each man had a chance to drive in a car — which, naturally, featured a rose painted on the side — with Jesse for a chance to impress Jenn.</p><p class=p1>“I might have knocked over a few cones,” Jeremy, 29, quips in a confessional. “But, I’m doing decently well.”</p><p class=p1>At the end of the competition, the man who performs the best will win a coveted solo date later that evening.</p><p class=p1>Monday’s episode will also feature a larger group date for her suitors to showcase their stage abilities in local revue Thunder Down Under and a special one-on-one date for one lucky man.</p><p class=p1>Melbourne is the first international stop on Jenn’s journey to find a “ferocious love,” which she previously told <i>Us </i>ended up being unexpected.</p><p class=p1>“This season definitely breaks the mold in a lot of different ways,” she <a href=#>exclusively told </a><i><a href=#>Us</a> </i>earlier this month. “I never saw myself as the Bachelorette because, for me, the Bachelorette [is] someone who’s so confident, so poised, is articulate, can emotionally emote and can be vulnerable. I just didn’t know if I could do all that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bachelorette-Sneak-Peek-Jenn.jpg><p class=p1>She added, “I never saw myself as a main character [and] I never saw myself as someone with that much confidence, and so what I really learned is that it’s not about fitting a mold of the Bachelorette. It’s about being able to just be yourself the best that you can, and that’s really what my whole journey is about — me being myself and embracing all of my flaws and everything that makes me unique.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>All in all, Jenn is “very happy” with how her <a href=#>season 21 of </a><i><a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> </i>played out.</p><p class=p1>“I can say that I definitely opened my heart up to a lot of different connections and explored a lot of these,” she told <i>Us</i>. “The way that things panned out throughout the journey and the way that things ended, I’m very happy about [it].”</p><p class=p1><i>The Bachelorette </i>airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2BxK2rnmWjo7Kit4ypnJ6jXZ%2Byr7qMramapl2prqyx0maknqZdqbxuucSlmaitoqOybr7AnJxmrKKWsKx7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
